### Context

The current approach to feature testing, using RSpec and Capybara, has a number of drawbacks:

* Due to lack of coverage or quantity of quarantined specs, the feature suite overall provides limited confidence in code changes and fails to catch regressions.
* Low level of stability leads to high frequency of broken master.
* Limited debugging tools make it difficult to create stable tests and debug flaky ones.
* Maintenance of tests written in Ruby is frequently the responsibility of Frontend engineers, who may or may not have skill in this language.

### Goals

This Working Group has the following goals:

1. Establish the credibility of an alternative JavaScript-based testing system, [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), as an alternative to Capybara (or potentially RSpec+Capybara).
2. Create a proof of concept using Playwright with a part of the GitLab platform.
3. Create an architecture blueprint with a strategy on how to migrate to Playwright.

#### Details

**Data Management**

RSpec includes numerous tools to create objects in Rails with database access.
We need to determine a solution for this in Playwright.
This will include ways to set up/tear down test data, database seeding, and managing of fixtures and factories.

**Authentication**

We'll need to determine how to simulate user authentication.

**CI/CD**

Need to set up CI pipelines running Node.js. Look into how to parallelize the running of tests, with a goal of quicker pipelines than the current RSpec solution.

**Environment Setup**

Ensure system can be installed with the GDK, and the test suite can be run with minimal setup.

**Migration Plan**

Strategy to take to gradually migrate to Playwright.
