title: "Change Management Policy"
---

## Purpose

This policy is intended to outline the change management controls implemented by GitLab.

## Scope

Changes, in the context of this policy, are defined as **modifications**, including, but not limited to:

- Creation/development/implementation of new systems, integrations, features, key reports, databases, etc.
- Changes to configurations
- Deployment of patches or vendor supplied changes not managed by the vendor
- Modifications to data schemas
- System deprecation
- New access or role creation
- Broadly speaking, any change that will impact how team members carry out their responsibilities

The policy applies to changes that are made to systems assigned a [Critical System Tier](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/critical-systems/) of `Tier 1 Mission Critical`, `Tier 2 Business Critical`, and `Tier 3 Business Operational`.

{{% note %}}
While Tier 4 Administrative systems are not subject to the scope of this policy, team members are encouraged to proactively adopt the requirements established by this policy across all systems, especially if there is a good probability that a system may move from a `Tier 4 Administrative` system to a [higher system tier](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/critical-systems/) handbook page.
