## What do I do if I accidentally opened a security MR in public ?

Check if the related confidential security issue has the label `~"security-fix-in-public"`. This label means that the security issue is [already accepted](/handbook/security/product-security/application-security/vulnerability-management/#fixing-in-public) to be to be addressed in public, so it is ok to have this MR in public. If this is not the case then [Engage the Security Engineer On-Call](/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/engaging-security-on-call/#engage-the-security-engineer-on-call) to delete the MR and branch.

## Who can I contact if my Stable Counterpart is out of office?

In GitLab, @ mention `@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/appsec` and the AppSec engineer on rotation will respond. In Slack, reach out on `#sec-appsec`.

## I ran a scan on 3rd party images used by GitLab and found vulnerabilities on them. Can they be updated?

We do not maintain 3rd party images. As appropriate we will follow our [Disclosure Guidelines for Vulnerabilities in 3rd Party Software](https://about.gitlab.com/security/disclosure/#disclosure-guidelines-for-vulnerabilities-in-3rd-party-software), our [Vulnerability Management Policy](../vulnerability-management/), and our [Release and Maintenance Policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html).

## A customer wants to know if a GitLab vulnerability affects them, or if the score is accurate?

In release blog posts after `17.2.2` the CVSS (severity) score links to an explanation page.
It describes the components that make up the CVSS score and provides some _potential_ mitigations that might inform a customer as to how they might reduce the risk for their own organization.
For an example, see [AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/product-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/explain#explain=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).

When a release goes out the content in the blog post is all that GitLab can publicly disclose at that time.
Requests for more detail may be denied until the issue is made public.
Refer to our [Process for disclosing security issues](/handbook/security/engaging-with-security/#process-for-disclosing-security-issues).
