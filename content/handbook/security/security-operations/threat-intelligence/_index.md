## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Engaging Threat Intelligence

Please follow our [RFI process](#requests-for-information-rfi) to contact the team.

For a less formal discussion, you can find us in Slack in the `#sd_security_threat_intel` channel.

## <i class="fas fa-rocket" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Our Vision

Empower GitLab to make informed, intelligence-driven decisions that keep our company and customers secure, while setting a new standard for transparency and collaboration across the industry.

## <i class="fas fa-compass" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Our Mission Statement

Our mission is to provide actionable intelligence that empowers GitLab to make informed, proactive decisions about security.

We monitor the threat landscape with a focus on identifying the most relevant risks to GitLab. We analyze these risks, track the associated threat actors, and build relationships with industry peers. These connections give us access to timely, unique insights that are not otherwise available. We focus on extracting the information most relevant to our organization, allowing us to deliver clear, concise reports that recommend immediate actions.

By staying vigilant and sharing targeted intelligence, we strive to help GitLab anticipate challenges, move swiftly, and protect our customers and our platform.

## <i class="fas fa-users" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> The Team

### Current Structure

The Threat Intelligence initiative is driven by cross-functional participants from SIRT and the Red Team, who dedicate 10-20% of their time to the program while still prioritizing their primary roles. They focus on building capabilities, delivering actionable intelligence, and demonstrating early results.

### Current Priorities

The initiative's current priorities are:

1. **Delivering actionable intelligence**: Preparing and presenting concise, actionable reports that inform GitLab of relevant threats, their potential impact, and recommended actions.
1. **Building meaningful connections**: Establishing relationships with industry peers, government entities, and other experts who specialize in the top threats most impactful to GitLab.

As the program matures, we will also include automation and AI as top priorities.

### Threat Intelligence Champions Program

We reward GitLab team members for reporting emerging threats that lead to:

- Enhanced detection and response capabilities for imminent risks.
- Preventative measures against credible, near-term threats.
- Timely discovery of active malicious activity on GitLab.com or our corporate systems.

These threats can surface anywhere - in chat rooms, social media, online forums, and beyond. As a GitLab team member, you're uniquely positioned to spot these risks during your daily online interactions.

To participate:

1. Open an issue using this template (TODO: LINK)
2. Share an intro and a link to your issue in the Slack channel `#sd_security_threat_intel`

We review all submissions, prioritizing high-quality reports that are timely, relevant, and actionable. Submissions selected for inclusion in a Flash Report or Threat Briefing earn (TODO: REWARD TBA).

### Threat Intelligence Reports

Reports are the foundation of our Threat Intelligence program and are always actionable. We use GitLab.com to write the reports, enabling collaboration and allowing direct linking to recommendations and results.

All reports, regardless of type, consistently:

- Include linked issues with clearly defined next steps to address each topic covered
- Answer the following questions for each threat addressed:
  - How is this relevant to GitLab?
  - How well is GitLab prepared to deal with this threat today?
  - What steps is GitLab taking to better handle this threat?

The specific reports types we offer are described below.

#### Flash Reports

Flash Reports are delivered on an ad-hoc basis in response to rapidly emerging threats. They focus on a single topic, generally a specific threat actor, campaign, or vulnerability.

These reports help GitLab make quick decisions to protect our customers and our organization.

Recommendations linked to Flash Reports are often time-sensitive and critical. They are leveraged for activities like:

- Rapid iterations to security controls and detection capabilities
- Threat hunting
- Security communications
- Purple Team Flash Operations

Flash Reports use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/flash_report.md?ref_type=heads).

#### Threat Insights

Threat Insights offer regular, high-level updates on the evolving threat landscape. They highlight the most relevant trends, actors, and campaigns that could affect GitLab in the coming weeks or months.

These reports help team members stay informed, vigilant, and prepared.

Recommendations linked to Threat Insights are not as time-sensitive as those from a Flash Report. They are leveraged for activities like:

- Product roadmap and prioritization
- Standard iterations to security controls and detection capabilities
- Training on security awareness and job-specific skills
- Purchasing decisions and vendor evaluations

Threat Insights are produced monthly using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/threat_insights.md?ref_type=heads) and include a live presentation with a Q&A session.

### Threat Actor Tracking

Threat Actor Tracking is an ongoing effort where we closely monitor the threat actors that pose the greatest risk to GitLab. By continuously monitoring their activities, tactics, and techniques, we develop a better understanding of their motivations and capabilities.

This intelligence helps us anticipate their next moves and proactively strengthen our defenses. It also helps us attribute early indicators to these groups, giving us a heads-up when they are actively targeting us.

Threat Actor Tracking is done inside our Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP).

### Requests For Information (RFI)

RFIs allow GitLab team members to request our help in analyzing threats and making intelligence-informed decisions. Team Members can [open an issue in our tracker using the RFI template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-issue-tracker/-/issues/new).

Some examples where an RFI can provide value:

- Investigating active security incidents
- Decisions on product security features and functionality
- Third-party vendor and product evaluations

Supporting S1 incidents will always take priority over all other work.

Requests for Information use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/threat-intelligence-public/resources/threat-intelligence-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/rfi.md?ref_type=heads).

## <i class="fas fa-chart-simple" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How We Measure Success

We measure the success of our threat intelligence program using three key metrics: Impact, Adoption Rate, and Attribution. We track these metrics using GitLab.com issues and custom labels.

1. Impact: Measures how often our intelligence helps prevent incidents, detect attacks, and improve response times, and drive significant product improvements that keep our customers secure.
1. Adoption Rate: Measures the extent to which our intelligence-driven recommendations are accepted and implemented.
1. Attribution: Measures the accuracy, relevance, and source of our intelligence by tracking how often it is validated by real-life events.

Monitoring these metrics helps us continually refine our services, prioritize high-impact activities, and demonstrate the value of our program.
