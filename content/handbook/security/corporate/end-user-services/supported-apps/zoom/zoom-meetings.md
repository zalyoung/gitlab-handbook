## Setting up a Zoom Meeting

*To set up a Zoom meeting, sign into Zoom via Okta and share the link for your "personal meeting room" with your participants.*

### Allow for browsers

As not every external contact has the Zoom client installed, you should ensure that the ability to join meetings from a browser is enabled if needed.

1. Go to **Settings > In Meeting (Advanced)**
1. Click next to "Show a 'Join from your browser' link" to make this option available in your meeting invites.

The browser version of Zoom is not as full-featured as the regular client, but it doesn't force an invitee to download the Zoom client.

### Large meeting considerations

It can be distracting when a call with a large number of attendees has folks joining unmuted. For [Assembly](/handbook/company/gitlab-all-company-meetings/), CEO [AMAs](/handbook/communication/ask-me-anything), and other meetings in which we expect an attendance of over 25 folks, meetings should be scheduled, so that folks enter on mute. These folks can then opt to unmute as required to participate in the conversation.

If a team member in a meeting is not on mute but creating sound that is distracting, any other team member should feel empowered to put this person on mute. A person must be a co-host or host to put someone on mute.\ 
If you are the host and you'd like help with muting people, ensure that "co-host" is enabled in your Zoom settings. During meetings, you can click on individuals in the meeting and designate them as "co-hosts".

### Settings for smaller meetings

If you have a smaller meeting (4 or fewer participants) and want to allow for quicker starts, you could change the settings on a per meeting basis to remove the waiting room, or default audio to on (can be overridden by participants local settings).

To quickly do this, you can:

1. Ensure that you are signed into the Zoom extension that is installed by default in your GitLab Chrome profile
1. When creating a meeting, click on `Make it a Zoom Meeting`
1. Uncheck `Waiting Room`
1. Ensure Host and Participant Video is `On`
1. Ensure `Mute participants upon entry` is **unchecked**
1. Click `Continue`

This should allow for a bit more of a seamless transition into beginning a smaller meeting. The defaults for larger meetings are still what's documented above.

## During your Zoom Meeting

*Zoom can be [minimized](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063672#h_29171b3b-71eb-4b42-8bc4-30bf2f778d95) during a meeting (`cmd-m` on macOS) to a small window staying on top of all applications.
This tip is very handy when using a small screen: it allows to see the participant(s) and use other applications at the same time without worrying about the screen layout.*

### Join meetings with muted microphone

Joining an ongoing meeting with your microphone not muted can cause disruptions. As we sometimes forget to quickly mute ourselves, Zoom provides an [option to join calls muted](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0062614):

1. Navigate to `Zoom > Preferences > Audio`
1. Scroll down and select the box `Mute my mic when joining a meeting`
