## About Vimeo

Vimeo is a video hosting, sharing, creating and services platform.

## Access

### Single access

Vimeo is connected to Okta. To request access, [create an access request](/handbook/it/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/) and use the GitLab user group `gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/helpdesk` to provision you. Make sure to include the business case for why you would like access and tag a team member from brand video. Once provisioned to Vimeo, brand video can adjust your permission set as needed.

### Bulk access

If a team is needing access to Vimeo, please open a [bulk access request](/handbook/it/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request) and use the GitLab user group `@gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/helpdesk` to provision you. Once access is granted, please ping `@joanna_c` to update permissions for each user in the group.

### User Roles

[Managing team members on your account](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/224818687-Managing-team-members-on-your-account)

1. `Viewers` - Viewers can be invited to specific folders within the account, but they will have limited access to the contents of those folders. They can access the review page, leave notes, and share videos that are within those folders. They do not have the ability to upload, edit, publish, or access any other settings or areas of the account that are meant for working members.
1. `Contributors` - Contributors can be invited to access a specific folder within the account. They'll have the ability to upload, edit, review, share, and publish videos within a folder, but won't have access to any of your other folders or areas of your account. A contributor also won't be able to change the title of a folder, delete a folder, or delete a video from the account. They can view settings of a video in that folder as well as the analytics tab, which has numbers from the past 30 days but won't have access to advanced analytics for the video. Once in the `Video Manager`, Contributors will only be able see the folders to which they have been invited. In addition, contributors can access settings of an archived live event within the folder to which they contribute. Contributors can start a live event to Vimeo if they are using an external encoder via RTMP (after the Owner or Admin creates an event and provides the Contributor with the RTMP URL and Stream Key). **Note:** If the Vimeo account is connected to other social accounts such as Facebook, then any live events the Contributor starts from their encoder will also simulcast to that destination.
1. `Admins` - Admins can help upload and manage all videos, folders, and collections. Admins will not be able to access account settings or payment information. Admins also cannot delete videos; only the account owner can do this. Admins have access to the following features:
   - Creating, managing, and deleting collections
   - Creating, managing, and deleting folders
   - Changing the privacy settings of your videos
   - Viewing advanced analytics of your videos
   - Create live events
   - Adjust privacy settings, embed customization, and interaction tool settings for live events
   - Stream to live events using WebRTC or RTMP from an external encoder
   - End live events
   - Export chat transcripts
1. `Owners` - Only Owners can do the following:
   - Edit and organize the account's profile page
   - Access Simulcast settings
   - Authenticate API-integrated encoders and applications - This means any encoder that allows you to connect to Vimeo by logging in to account directly from the software or application (e.g. Livestream Studio via login, Mevo, Vimeo mobile app, or other third-party direct integrations)
   - Delete live events
   - Access Developer API and create and manage developer apps for their account

## Video Manager

The [video manager](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004610668-The-video-manager) is where all the video uploads are stored and managed.

When you navigate to Vimeo.com, you first land in the video manager (when logged in). The video manager houses all videos uploaded, both public and private, as well as video drafts, showcases, and any live events.

You can also navigate to the `Videos` sidebar menu option to access the video manager.

### Create a Folder

1. Click the `+` icon next to the `Videos` sidebar menu option.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the folder.
1. If you want to share this folder with specific team members, add them by email address or by selecting them from the team members in the account list.
1. In the `Notifications` tab, you can toggle the ability to connect to Slack to send folder notifications so you can track team activity on videos, review pages, and more.
1. When done inputting your folder info and options, click `Create`.

### Video Deletion Policy

Only the `Owner` role has the ability to delete videos in Vimeo. As such, we have a folder in Vimeo named `TO BE DELETED`. If you have a video that you would like to mark for deletion, please move it to this folder. Note that the `Owner` role will delete any videos in this folder that are older than 30 days or upon request.

## Create

[Vimeo Create](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037832151-Vimeo-Create-overview) is Vimeo's new video maker tool. It allows you to easily and quickly create your own video from stock videos, photos, and personal videos. [See the knowledge base article](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037832151-Vimeo-Create-overview) for a full tutorial.

## Upload

Vimeo accepts most video file formats (MP4, MOV, WMV, AVI, and FLV). Vimeo does not accept audio files, image files, or other non-video formats (MP3, WAV, WMA, JPG, and PNG). If you compress your source file prior to upload, follow [these guidelines](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/12426043233169-Video-and-audio-compression-guidelines). For more information on uploading videos to Vimeo, [see this help article](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/229838988-Preparing-to-upload).

### Email capture

[Email capture](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/224819147-Email-capture) can appear before, during, or after a video, with the option to "gate" your video behind the email capture field, or let viewers skip it.

You can set up the email capture screen to appear before, during, or after your embedded videos, then download those email addresses. There is no direct integration between Vimeo and Marketo. You can only set up one email capture screen per video. For example, if you've already chosen to display the email capture screen before your video, you'll no longer see the options to display it during or after in the embed settings. **Note:** Email capture is not supported on Facebook or Twitter.

**Setting up email capture**

1. Navigate to the `Interaction tools` tab in your video's settings.
1. Select to enable email capture before, during, or after your video. If you choose to display the email capture screen before or during your video, you have the option to allow or prevent viewers from skipping the email capture screen. You also have the option to add a custom message, up to 100 characters in length, that will display along with the email capture fields.

**Interaction stats for email capture**

From the stats panel for your video, you can check the number of times the email capture screen has been seen and the number of email addresses submitted for the past 30 days. [Learn more about stats for video interaction tools](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/12426973464465-Live-analytics-overview).

**Downloading all captured emails as a CSV**

On the `Marketing` tab of `Account Settings`, you can download a CSV of all the emails captured through your embedded videos. The CSV contains the name (if provided), video ID, domain, and date captured associated with each email address. To download the CSV:

1. Click the button below the `Download email addresses` heading. The first time you download the CSV, you will be prompted to accept the following terms:
    - I will only use collected email addresses for marketing purposes.
    - I will not share these email addresses with others.
    - I will comply with CAN-SPAM, CASL, and any other applicable laws.
    - I will provide an unsubscribe mechanism and comply promptly with opt-out requests.

Once you accept, the CSV will download.

**Download captured emails for an individual video**

If you only want the email addresses from one particular video, you can download that CSV by navigating to your video manager. Select the desired video then navigate to `Analytics` > `Interaction` and click `Download email addresses`.

### Cards

[Cards](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007469808-Cards) are a customizable, notification-style layer that you can set to appear during playback and remain on the screen for six seconds.

### End screens

[End screens](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007893267-End-screens) allow you to determine exactly what appears when videos finish playing.

## Showcases

With a [showcase](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/228908367-Showcases), you can organize videos together to share publicly or privately.
