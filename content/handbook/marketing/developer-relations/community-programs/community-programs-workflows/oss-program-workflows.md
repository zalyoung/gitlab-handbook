## Overview

This page contains details regarding workflows specific to the [GitLab for Open Source Program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/).
Because the GitLab for Open Source Program is part of GitLab's [Community Programs](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/), team members verify applications by using the team's standard, seven-step application workflow.
See [the handbook page](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/community-programs-workflows/) on that workflow for details that pertain to all GitLab community programs.

## Program application form

GitLab engages a third party, [SheerID](https://www.sheerid.com/), to assist with processing program applications and verifying that applicants meet program requirements.
Applicants must complete [a SheerID form](https://offers.sheerid.com/gitlab/member/) to apply for the GitLab for Open Source Program:
This SheerID form contains the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address
- Country (drop down list)
- Open Source Organization or Project Name
- Project Description
- Publicly Visible Project on GitLab
- OSI Approved License
- Not Seeking Profile (checkbox)
- Marketing email opt-in (checkbox)

The SheerID form also includes the following statement, added with help from GitLab's legal team:

> By submitting this form, you understand that your information will be shared with GitLab by SheerID and used for verification purposes.
>
> For more information please see the [GitLab's Privacy Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/).
>
> If you are accepted into the GitLab for Open Source Program, you will be subject to [GitLab's terms and conditions](/handbook/legal/opensource-agreement/). All use of GitLab products must comply with United States export control and economic sanction laws.

For reasons relating to trade controls, we are unable to accept applicants from Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine.

## Verifying applicants

Eligibility requirements for the GitLab for Open Source Program are listed in the [program's handbook page](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/open-source-program/).
SheerID assists GitLab with reviewing program applications and ensuring applicants meet these program requirements.

SheerID is unable to completely automate the [Verification phase](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/automated-community-programs/#verification) of the application workflow for the GitLab for Open Source Program.
This means the program manager and other trained team members must verify applications with some amount of manual effort.
Verification for the GitLab for Open Source Program will require an application processing team until further automation is implemented.
The team plans to explore ways to more fully automate the application process of the program in the future.
However, SheerID is able to make the review process easier by doing the following:

- Requesting screenshots to verify the project's publicly visible status and application of OSI-approved licenses
- Asking the applicant to check a box to certify they are not seeking profit with their project

When applicants submit forms to the GitLab for Open Source Program, those forms enter a review queue.
Note that:

- Applications in the queue expire after 20 days
- The queue displays only the 20 most recently submitted applications; when processed, older applications become visible

Applicants have two attempts to upload a documentation verifying their eligibility for the GitLab for Open Source Program.
Upon two unsuccessful attempts, applicants will be rejected and must contact `opensource@gitlab.com` if they wish to discuss their eligibility.

Program managers use SheerID to review these documents via the [SheerID Review Portal](https://my.sheerid.com/).
To do this:

 1. Login to MySheerID and navigate to the "Document review" section.
 1. Click "Begin" or click on any open application to view.
 1. _Verify license type:_ Make sure that an OSI approved license is being used by checking the screenshot against this [OSI license list](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).
 1. _Verify public settings:_ make sure there is a screenshot showing that the project is publicly visible and accepting collaborators.
 1. Visit the applying namespace on GitLab to verify that all remaining projects in the namespace meet program requirements. Use the [OS License Checker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/os-license-checker) if necessary (see below).
 1. If application meets all criteria, `Approve` the application; `Reject` it if not.

Reviewers should be sure to check different views in the "Review Documents" section.
A drop-down field takes reveals applications "On Hold" and "Escalated."

Successfully verified applicants receive a welcome email containing a coupon code and instructions for activating their subscriptions.
See the [Community Programs Applications Workflow](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/community-programs-workflows/) for additional details on what follows.

If GitLab's open source programs team is unable to determine an applicant's eligibility based on the screenshots the applicant provided via the SheerID Review Portal, the team will review the applicant's namespace directly.
In cases where a namespace contains several projects in need to verification, the team will use the [OS License Checker tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/os-license-checker) to automate scanning and validation of the namespace.
If the namespace does not qualify for the program, the team will send the applicant a rejection email that follows [the team's correspondence template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/community-programs/operations/-/tree/main/support-macros/opensource).
Applicants can then contact `opensource@gitlab.com` if they believe the rejection was sent in error, or if they have additional questions about eligibility.

## Verification limit

Any individual can apply through the form and attempt verification up to five times per 365-day period.
This limit provides room for error and allows a single individual to apply for licenses on behalf of multiple open source projects.
This limit is determined by GitLab and set by SheerID.
It can be changed at any time.
