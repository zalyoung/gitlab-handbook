Transactions that require your attention (such as adding a receipt), will appear at the top of the screen, in the `To dos` section. You can access your Navan profile to manage your personal card for reimbursements and calendar integrations from the badge in the top right corner.

- **Receipt scanner:** Take or upload a photo of your receipt, and all relevant details will auto-populate into the corresponding fields.
- **Personal card import:** Link your personal card(s) and import transactions for reimbursement.
  - Note: This option is only available to users with a United States-based bank account.
- **Type in expenses:** Manually type in your transaction details if you cannot link a personal card or have misplaced your receipt.
- **Receipt Import:** Email Navan (*receipts@navan.com*) a copy of your receipt(s) and they will automatically be added to an existing Navan Expense transaction or created as a transaction draft.

{{% panel header="**IMPORTANT NOTE**" header-bg="danger" %}}

- Receipts need to be forwarded from your GitLab email to *receipts@navan.com* in order to be attached to your Navan Expense account. After sending the email, the receipt should show up within a few minutes to a few hours.

### How to modify or add transaction details

Modify Navan Expense transactions to provide additional details, such as adding a receipt, linking associated trips, modifying the expense type, or adding participants. This includes transaction drafts, submitted expenses that are pending review, or when your company's Expense admin has requested additional information.

#### Accessing Transactions Details

Transactions are organized into folders based on transaction type. Select a folder to view all transactions that fall under the transaction type, then choose a transaction to modify the transaction details following the steps below:

- Navigate to the `My transactions` section of your Navan mobile app .

- Choose the transaction you would like to modify or withdraw and proceed with any of the changes outlined below.

#### Add a Receipt

Depending on your assigned policy, you may be required to attach a copy of your receipt to an expense. If you did not submit a required receipt with your transaction initially, you can add it by scrolling to the bottom of any transaction detail page and selecting `Add` under the `Receipt` section.

> For instructions on how to upload multiple receipts to the same transaction, check the *[How to attach multiple receipts to the same transaction](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/#how-to-attach-multiple-receipts-to-the-same-transaction)* section.

#### Add Participants

Participants can be added to certain transaction types to provide your company admin or manager with additional context around your spend. For example, you may wish to add participant information to your transaction for a team event, meal or a transaction for an UberXL where multiple passengers were present to justify a higher cost. To add a participant(s):

- On the transaction details page, tap the `Participants` field.
  - *Note: If you do not see the participants field, this indicates the transaction type is not eligible to have this information submitted.*
- A `Search` box will appear where you can type in the name of each participant.
  - Other Navan users from your company will appear on the list of participants to select from, and their information will be pre-populated.
  - To add participants outside of your company, such as customers or guests, use the `+` icon to enter the new participant's information (first name, last name, and email address).
- Tap `Save` to save your changes.

![liquid-image-1](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/add-participants.png)

#### Change expense type

Expense types for transactions charged to Navan cards will be automatically assigned based on the merchant where the card is used. However, you must still confirm that the transaction is assigned to the correct expense type. If you submit an expense with the incorrect expense type, your transaction may be flagged for review by your approver. From there, they will determine whether the transaction can be approved as is or sent back to you to assign the correct expense category. If you need to re-assign the transaction to a different expense type, follow the steps below:

- On the transaction details page, tap the `Expense type` field.
- Navan will provide a list of suggested categories or you can select from a list of `all expense types`.
- Tap `Save` to save your changes.

#### Add or Edit a General Ledger (GL) Code

GitLab uses GL codes to map and track spend for specific types of expenses. If the system admins have provided you with the ability to add or edit the GL code associated with your transaction, you will be able to do so at the time you are submitting your transaction (for manual/out-of-pocket expenses). To add or edit a GL code, find the appropriate transaction and follow the steps below:

- On the transaction details page, tap the `GL code` field.
- Search for a GL code or scroll through the list provided.
- Select a GL code and click `Save`.
- Tap `Save` on the transaction detail page.

![liquid-image-3](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/change-gl.png)

#### Link a Related Trip

Transactions made with a Navan card during a business trip will automatically be associated with corresponding travel booked on the Navan platform. For manual (out-of-pocket expenses), you will need to ensure this information is correctly entered before submitting your expense. To associate an expense with a trip, follow the steps below:

- On the transaction details page, tap the `Trip` field.
- Navan Expense will provide a list of suggested trips booked in Navan for you to select from.
- Once a trip has been selected, tap `Save` to save your changes.

![liquid-image-4](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/related-trip.png)

#### Withdraw a Transaction

If you submit a manual transaction for an out-of-pocket expense that is not compliant with your assigned expense policy, it will be flagged for review by your expense approver. These transactions will be marked as `In review` and can be found in the `Manual` folder of the `My Transactions` section. If you would like to withdraw one of these transactions before your approver has taken action, you may do so by following the steps below:

- On the transaction details page, tap the `ellipsis` in the top right corner.
- Click `Withdraw transaction` to permanently delete the transaction.

Once a transaction has been withdrawn, it will no longer appear on the admin's dashboard or under your transaction history.

### How to attach multiple receipts to the same transaction

### How to itemize a transaction in Navan Expense

Navan Expense provides you with the ability to automatically split a single transaction into multiple items, allowing for the assignment of expense types, GL codes, custom fields, and the approval or rejection of the transaction by the admin on a per-item basis. A common use case for itemization is hotel expenses, where certain charges should be covered by GitLab (i.e. the hotel's nightly rate or parking cost) while others should be covered with your personal funds (i.e. spa services utilized at the hotel).

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Users can itemize their own manual transactions at any time **before they have been submitted** or after submission only if a transaction has been flagged for review by the system admin and has not yet been actioned by them.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% panel header="**IMPORTANT NOTE**" header-bg="danger" %}}

- Transaction itemization is not currently available on the web app.
{{% /panel %}}

#### Itemizing a manual transaction

2. Start a new transaction.
3. Tap `Scan a receipt` to allow Navan to auto-fill your transaction information or `Type in details` to input the transaction information manually.

   - *Note: When itemizing lodging expenses, you will be prompted to enter additional fields for the transaction, including hotel check-in and check-out dates, cost of stay, and nightly rate.*
6. Tap `Continue`, then `Let's do it!` to start categorizing your items.
7. Review the items captured from the receipt. Change the expense type, delete an item, or mark an item as a personal expense to remove it from the portion that will be submitted for reimbursement. Tap `Add new item` if you need to another item to the transaction.
8. Tap `Save` to finish and submit your transaction.

![liquid-image-8](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/itemize.png)

#### Itemizing a manual transaction after expense submission

Manual transactions are automatically approved when submitted if they fall within the parameters of your assigned expense policy and cannot be itemized. If a submitted non-itemized manual transaction has been flagged for review by the system admin for being non-compliant with your assigned expense policy, you will have the opportunity to itemize it before the admin has approved or rejected.

1. Tap the `Needs your review` tile on the homepage of your Navan Expense app.
2. Select a transaction.
3. Tap `Itemize` and follow the steps outlined in the [Itemizing a manual transaction](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/#itemizing-a-manual-transaction) section. You can edit the itemization until it is approved or rejected by your company admin

### How to automatically add a receipt to a Navan Expense transaction

Forward email receipt to Navan Expense to automatically match it to existing transactions. Receipts sent to Navan will be imported and analyzed to auto-fill transaction details for you allowing to review, then submit.

{{% panel header="**IMPORTANT NOTE**" header-bg="danger" %}}

- Multiple receipts in an email will be cataloged as one transaction. If you need to submit receipts for more than one transaction, forward them as separate emails.
{{% /panel %}}

#### Emailing Receipts to Navan

Receipts emailed to Navan will be scanned, and the transaction information will be imported to your Navan Expense account. Receipts that match an existing transaction will automatically be added to that transaction. If a match is not found, a new transaction draft will be created using the receipt and transaction details. To import a receipt, email a copy of your receipt to *receipts@navan.com* from your **GitLab work email**.

Once received, a push notification (if enabled on your device) will confirm that your receipt was successfully imported and inform you of its status:

- **Successful receipt/transaction match:** Shortly after emailing your receipt, you will receive a push notification that your receipt has been matched with an existing Navan Expense transaction. Tap the notification to be directed to the transaction in the mobile app, or navigate to the `My Transactions` section to view the transaction to which the receipt was added. Review the transaction to confirm that all of the information is correct.
- **Draft created:** Shortly after emailing your receipt, you will receive a push notification that your receipt has been imported and that a transaction draft has been created and saved in the `Drafts` folder. Open the transaction to review, fill in all required fields, then submit.

![liquid-image-26](/images/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/emailing-receipts.png)

### How to submit a mileage reimbursement request

Navan Expense provides you with a quick and simple way to get reimbursed for mileage driven for business in your personal vehicle. The expense policy assigned to you for on-the-job expenses by GitLab's Navan Expense admin will determine your mileage reimbursement eligibility.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Mileage is only available in the Navan Expense Mobile App. Download the app from your preferred [mobile app store](https://app.navan.com/app/liquid/user/redirect).
{{% /alert %}}

#### Submitting a Mileage Expense (Available on the mobile app only)

To submit a request for mileage reimbursement, tap `+New transaction`, then `Log distance driven`. Proceed with completing your trip details.

- You can enter in your drive origin and destination using Google maps and select your route, or enter this information in manually. Your distance driven and total reimbursement amount will be automatically calculated.
- Your reimbursement amount is calculated based upon the total distance traveled multiplied by the mileage rate reimbursed by GitLab (click into the `Information` icon next to `Total` to see this value).
- Lastly, enter in your `Date of travel` (required) and any additional details to provide your Navan Expense Admin team with more details and context for your expense (optional).

{{% panel header="**Note**" header-bg="danger" %}}

- If you do not see the option to `Log distance driven`, this indicates that your company has not assigned you to an expense policy that allows for mileage reimbursement. Contact the Accounts Payable team for more information.

### Repayments for Out-of-policy Expenses

Transactions charged to a physical Navan Expense card that violate the expense policy assigned to you by GitLab will be reviewed by the Accounts Payable team. Once reviewed, the approver may choose to reject the expense and request that you repay the company for the full transaction amount or a partial amount. Alternatively, if you are aware that a transaction will require repayment, you can make a payment before your approver reviews the transaction. Repayments can be processed directly through the Navan mobile app.

> Check the *[How can I repay my company for out-of-policy spend?](https://app.navan.com/app/helpcenter/articles/expense/myself/managing-my-expenses/repaying-company)* article for more details.

### How to submit or manage an expense for someone else

#### Removing Yourself as a Delegate

To remove yourself as a delegate for another team member, select the `X` next to the name of the person you would like to remove from the list of people you book travel for. Once the user is removed, they will receive an email notifying them of the change.

#### Reviewing transactions on behalf of another user

1. Repeat the [steps as outlined](#submitting-a-manual-expense-for-another-user) to log in as a different user.  Note that they'll need to [delegate you with access to their account](#designating-delegate-access-to-another-team-member) first.
1. You will then be able to review any transactions submitted, including their teams' transactions if that user is a manager.

#### Managing transactions for another user

- Manual transactions: Manual transactions submitted for reimbursement will fall under one of four review categories (accessed under `Transactions`). If a transaction requires further action, such as requests for more information, a missing receipt, or repayment to the company for partially or fully rejected submissions, you can take action by logging in as the user as outlined in the above section.
- Navan card transactions: Transactions charged on a user's physical Navan card will be auto-approved if they are compliant with that user's assigned expense policy. Transactions that are not auto-approved may require additional action, such as providing more information, attaching a missing receipt, or repaying the company if the transaction has been partially or fully rejected. If a transaction requires further action, you can complete any required information by logging in as the user as outlined in the above section.

### Leveraging the Navan Expense manager dashboard (available in the desktop browser only)

The Navan Expense Manager Dashboard gives managers an at-a-glance view of their direct reports' transaction activity and spend data, as well as the ability to review and approve transactions (for managers designated as expense approvers). The manager dashboard can be accessed from the Navan desktop browser by clicking on the main dropdown menu on the left, then `Manager` under the Expense section. The page has four main components and filters to narrow your search.

**Activity**

The Activity tab provides an overview of all transaction activity. Choose `Navan Expense transactions` to view all activity from Navan physical cards and virtual cards, or select `Manual transactions` to view all expenses submitted for reimbursement.

**Analysis**

The Analysis section of the Navan Expense Dashboard provides an overview of their company's business spend including transactions charged to a Navan Expense physical, virtual, and purchase card, as well as transactions submitted for manual reimbursement. Managers can use this information to:

- Group and visualize total spend and number of transactions.
- View a breakdown of different charge types (i.e. physical card vs. manual transaction) to see which methods are being used to submit expenses.
- Filter data across different time frames, groups, and issuing currencies.

Use the `Filters` at the top of the page to adjust the `Spend overview`. You have the ability to filter by time period, group, expense type, issuing currency, individual user, and more.

To access the dashboard, navigate to `Navan Travel > Manager > Analysis`. The `Overview` page will display your company's total spend categorized by charge type. Charge types are the different ways that employees can submit an expense in Navan Expense. You will see a breakdown of each (if applicable):

- **Physical Cards:** The total posted amount and number of transactions charged on Navan physical cards.
- **Virtual Cards:** The total posted amount and number of transactions for travel spend charged on Navan virtual cards.
- **Manual Transactions:** The total amount and number of approved transactions submitted manually for out-of-pocket expenses.

**Users**

The Users tab allow managers to view their direct reports' employee data such as their issuing currency, cost center, and more. Click on a user's name to view additional information including their transaction history and policy assignment. In addition to the Activity tab, designated approvers can review, approve, reject, and request more information for a transaction directly through a user's transaction history.

{{% alert title="Note" color="warning" %}}
Users designated as a manager on the Navan user list will have access to the Manager Dashboard. If you do not see a Manager Dashboard option available, either you do not have any assigned direct reports or your direct reports do not have any spend activity.

## Navan Expense Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What happens if I enter incorrect bank account information?

Account information is validated upon submission. However, we cannot validate that it is the correct account for you. Please ensure that you enter your bank account information correctly. Navan is not liable for money sent to the wrong account.

### What if I have a bank account transacted in currency outside of those supported?

If your bank account's currency is not currently supported or you wish to not link your bank account for other reasons, you can still receive reimbursements through GitLab's payroll. For details on GitLab's payroll cycle and process, contact the Accounts Payable Team.

### What if I don't want to link my personal card? How can I make repayments to my company?

If you do not link your personal card to Navan Expense and you owe GitLab a repayment for an expense that was not approved, you will need to connect with the Accounts Payable Team to determine the best method for repayment.

### In what countries are direct reimbursements available?

Please check [this section](/handbook/finance/expenses/#44-reimbursement-payout-timelines) of the Expense handbook page for information on reimbursements and payout timelines.

### How can I receive my funds if my reimbursement fails?

If your reimbursement fails, unlink, then relink your bank account from the `My reimbursements` tab on your mobile app or the `Settings` tab on the web app. Once relinked, Navan will resend the funds to your bank.

### Is it required that I include participants on my transactions?

While it is not required, adding participants to your transactions will give your Admin Team a better understanding of cost per person and help provide justification for more costly expenses.

### If I add colleagues to my transaction as participants, whose policy will be applied?

Adding participants to a transaction will not affect which policy is applied. Any transactions that you submit, regardless of participants entered, will be subject to the parameters set by your own assigned policies.

### Is it possible to expense mileage for a round trip drive?

Yes, simply click on the `+` icon when entering your destinations to add a location.

### Will I be able to submit for reimbursement in kilometers instead of miles?

The region assigned to you by your Navan Expense Admin Team will determine if you are able to submit in kilometers or miles. **Note:** If you are a US-based employee using your personal car on an international trip, you will still need to submit your reimbursement request in miles.

### Can I still submit mileage for travel, without attaching it to a trip booked on Navan?

Yes, as long as your assigned expense policy allows for mileage reimbursement.

### What rideshare applications can Navan connect to?

Navan offers connections with Lyft, Uber, and Grab so you can automatically share your location and destination information to access a ride while traveling.

> Check the *[What rideshare applications can Navan connect to?](https://app.navan.com/app/helpcenter/articles/travel/myself/getting-started-for-travelers/rideshare-applications)* article for more details.

### Can I automatically submit Lyft expenses?

Navan Expense users can connect their Lyft account to Navan Expense to automatically send receipts and submit expenses for business travel-related Lyft rides. To leverage this option, you will first need to create a Lyft business profile with the same email address you use in Navan.

> Check the *[How can I automatically submit Lyft expenses?](https://app.navan.com/app/helpcenter/articles/expense/myself/submitting-expenses/lyft-expenses)* article for more details.

### Is there anything I can't do in the web app that I can do in the mobile app?

To view your assigned expense policies or log miles driven for reimbursement, please use the Navan app. These features are not currently available in the web app.

### Should I add tax details for Navan Expense transactions?

Team members are not required to add tax details to any expense transactions.

> Check the *[How do I add tax information to my transactions?](https://app.navan.com/app/helpcenter/articles/expense/myself/submitting-expenses/tax-details)* article for more details.

### Are multiple receipts auto-approved paid in one lump sum or as separate reimbursements?

A deposit for each transaction will be made into your bank account. If you submit 5 manual expenses, you will receive 5 separate bank deposits for each individual transaction.

### If my expenses are rejected, can I go back to edit and resubmit?

Expenses will need to be fully resubmitted if rejected.

### Where can I see Navan Expense product releases?

Navan Expense product releases are shared in the following blog: [Navan Expense product release announcements](https://app.navan.com/app/helpcenter/articles/expense/admin/general-settings/navan-expense-product-release-announcements)
