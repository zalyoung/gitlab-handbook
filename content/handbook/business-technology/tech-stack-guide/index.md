## What Is A Tech Stack Guide?

> **Note:** Use the **[Tech Stack Index](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack/)** to browse Tech Stack Apps.

Every application should have a dedicated `Tech Stack Guide` handbook page to help everyone understand how the app is used, administered, and integrated with other systems. The audience of the Tech Stack Guide is anyone who needs to use the app, extend it, work with it, or understand how it fits into the rest of the GitLab Tech Stack ecosystem. Creation and maintenance of each Guide is a team effort and requires collaboration between the business system owner, technical owner, and others involved in implementation and operations. Each Tech Stack Guide lives within the Business Owner's Functional section of the handbook, along with other Function-based handbook content.

## Approach

The goal of this page is to describe how to document an application's `Tech Stack Guide`. **An apps Tech Stack Guide should live with the Functional Business Owner of the technology**. Our SSOT for all apps will be the [Tech Stack YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) and the YAML will populate key portions of the page. However, other sections of the page can be populated that are not included in the YAML file as needed to ensure that the documentation is complete such as Data Model, Integrations, Key Reports/Dashboards.

Here's how to think about the relationship between the Tech Stack YAML nd the Tech Stack Guide:

- The Tech Stack YAML is a registry of all apps GitLab owns or operates (the What)
- A Tech Stack Guide covers the business and technical workflows (the Why and How) of each Tech Stack app
- The `handbook_link` key/property in the YAML links to the corresponding Tech Stack Guide(s)

We also plan to have a second YAML file for our security applications called the Security Stack YAML that lives in the internal handbook. We will use the same template approach for these applications.

## Tech Stack Application Name

The Tech Stack single source of truth is the [Tech Stack YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) and contains more detail about this app.

```markdown
{{%/* tech-stack "Application Name" */%}}
```

### Implementation

Information about how the app was implemented, including links to GitLab epics and issues to help people understand where we started and how we arrived at this solution.

### System Diagram

Include some form of a diagram to illustrate how the system is deployed and what other apps it may be connected to. A [Mermaid Diagram(s)](https://mermaid-js.github.io/docs/mermaid-live-editor-beta/#/edit/) is ideal, but any diagram is better than none.

### Data Model

Include some form of an ER Diagram to illustrate the key data objects and their relationships with each other. You can create one with (ideally) [Mermaid ER diagram](https://mermaid-js.github.io/docs/mermaid-live-editor-beta/), LucidChart, or any other diagramming tool.

### Integrations

List the integrations between this app and other tech stack apps or systems. Include links to additional material if available, including the development project, code, diagrams, and issues.

### Key Reports / Dashboards

List the important reports and dashboards used to operate the application, including links where available.

## Tech Stack Guide Example #1: Thought Industries LMS Tech Stack Guide

[Thought Industries LMS Tech Stack Guide](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/education-services/lms/)

Important Notes:

1. This Tech Stack Guide lives in the [GitLab Professional Education Services](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/education-services) handbook because Professional Services are the business owners of the app
2. The `handbook_link` key in the [Tech Stack YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) for Thought Industries Learning Management System references the Tech Stack Guide

## Tech Stack Guide Example #2: Zuora Billing

### Code

```markdown
The Tech Stack single source of truth is the [Tech Stack YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) and contains more detail about this app.

{{%/* tech-stack "Zuora Billing" */%}}
```

### Result

The Tech Stack single source of truth is the [Tech Stack YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) and contains more detail about this app.

{{% tech-stack "Zuora Billing" %}}

### Implementation

Zuora consists of several app modules built on the [Zuora Central Platform](https://www.zuora.com/products/zuora-platform/). [Zuora Billing](https://www.zuora.com/products/billing-software/) is one of these modules.
