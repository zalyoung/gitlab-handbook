## Objectives for this page

This handbook page provides an overview of data definitions and data models used by the People Analytics team. Use this page for clarification on terminology, calculations, or models that use People data. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to someone from the team for help.

## Helpful places to start

- [DBT Docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/overview) - This resource contains comprehensive documentation on all available dbt models. This is a great starting point to understanding our models. For specific People Models, please reference the **Commonly Used Data Models** section below for a starting point.
- [Definitive guides to data subject areas](/handbook/enterprise-data/data-governance/data-catalog/) managed by the Data team.
- [Documentation on data pipelines](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/pipelines/) for the technically curious analyst. This page goes into each data source and extraction details.
- [People Group Tech Stack Guide](/handbook/people-group/tech-stack-guide-workday/) for overview of all the integrations that go into and out of our HR systems and all the tools we use.

## Data Models

The Data Team is working with the People Analytics team to build data marts that allow users to explore our different people data sources

- "mart" models are a combination of dimensions and facts that are joined together to enable easy analysis.
- "rpt" ("report") models are built with specific business logic for a specific use case.

Underneath each model is a clean lineage of dimensions and facts that can also be used for analysis. This list included all the prep tables, dimensions and facts that have been created for people analysis as well as the ones that we are planning to build in the upcoming quarters based on the [Team Member Common ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/17fbbbe5-f652-40e9-905e-1b07ec040520/edit?viewport_loc=153%2C6%2C1472%2C542%2CC6RZ78OfF1Bh&invitationId=inv_f6b923fd-02bb-4786-abd7-bf205c7d1da2)

### fct_team_member_absence

This table contains team members' absence information. Sensitive columns are masked using [dynamic masking](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/#dynamic-masking) and the fields are only visible by team members with the **analyst_people** role assigned in Snowflake. This table is a [Type 0 SCD](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/edw/#slowly-changing-dimensions--snapshots)

The table includes information from **Time Off By Deel**, . The grain of this table is one row per `team member ID` per `pto_uuid` and `absence_date` combination.

### mart_team_member_absence

This table is a derived mart from `fct_team_member_absence` and `dim_team_member`. Sensitive columns are masked and only visible by team members with the `analyst_people` role assigned in Snowflake. This table will be a replacement of the workspace table `wk_pto`.This table is a [hybrid SCD (Type 0 + Type 2)](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/edw/#slowly-changing-dimensions--snapshots).

 The grain of this table is one row per `team member ID` per `pto_uuid` and `absence_date` combination.

### mart_team_member_directory

This table is a derived fact from `fct_team_member_position` and `dim_team`. Sensitive columns are masked and only visible by team members with the `analyst_people` role assigned in Snowflake. This table will become a replacement of the legacy tables `employee_directory_*` once all the Workday data has been included in the upstream tables.

The grain of this table is one row per team member per valid_from/valid_to combination.

## Legacy and Other Data Models

Legacy models are models we will be transitioning from at some point but are still being used for reporting.

### Legacy Workday Data Models

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Click to expand</summary>

| Database | Schema | Table Name | Data Grain | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prod | legacy | [employee_directory_analysis](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.employee_directory_analysis) | `employee_id` by `date_actual` | Gives the current state of the team members at GitLab at any point of time. This is the model to use for headcount, team size, or any people-related analysis for team members. This has current and past team members, as well as their department, division, and cost center and hire/termination dates. | |
| prep | sensitive | [employee_directory_intermediate](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.employee_directory_intermediate) | `employee_id` by `date_actual` | INCLUDES SENSITIVE INFORMATION. The master collection of all info about GitLab team members for their latest position. | |
| prep | sensitive | [workday_terminations](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.workday_terminations) | `employee_id` | Provides the termination reason, and exit impact to allow the People Analytics team to accurately report on termination data | |
| prep | workday | [blended_directory_source](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.blended_directory_source) | `employee_id` by `uploaded_at` and `source_system` | Daily upload of team member data used for downstream models. | Helpful source for auditing any data issues in Snowflake |

### Greenhouse Data Models

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Click to expand</summary>

| Database | Schema | Table Name | Data Grain | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prod | workspace_people | [rpt_hires](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.rpt_hires) | `application_id` | This is a report specifically for talent acquisition and counts accepted offers as hires. |  |
| prep | greenhouse | [greenhouse_application_stages_source](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.greenhouse_application_stages_source) | `application_id` by `stage_id` and `stage_entered_on` | This table is Historical activity of all stages an application can be in Each row represents a stage that an application can be in, and the timestamp that the application entered and exited the stage Things to note: This table contains a row for each stage that an application can be in (taken from the job that the application is on). Thus, there may be rows for stages that an application has yet to reach, or will not reach (if the application was rejected). |  |
| prep | sensitive | [greenhouse_recruiting_xf](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.greenhouse_recruiting_xf) | `application_id` | This is shows all applications submitted and ties in offer data, greenhouse department (the associated division), and source data to be in 1 place. |  |
