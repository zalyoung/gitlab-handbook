This page focuses on how to edit the handbook.
Please see the [handbook usage page]({{< ref "handbook-usage" >}}) for how and why we use the handbook, and other [docs pages]({{< ref "docs" >}}) for further reference.

This page is intended to be complementary to [Using GitLab at GitLab](/handbook/people-group/using-gitlab-at-gitlab/#using-gitlab-competency).
We suggest you complete the [GitLab 101 Tool Certification](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/gitlab-101/) if you haven't already.

## Use the Web IDE to edit the handbook

A typical workflow to edit the handbook:

1. [Use the Web IDE to make changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/#use-the-web-ide).
1. [Commit changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/#commit-changes).
1. [Create a merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html), [assign reviewers](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#when-to-get-approval).
1. [Apply suggestions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/suggestions.html#apply-suggestions) if any.
1. Merge once all suggestions are resolved and you have the necessary approvals.

### Web IDE editing steps

1. Navigate to the handbook page you want to edit. At the bottom, or on the right, click on the URL `Edit this page` to open the new Web IDE.
    - Alternatively, open the [public handbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook) project and select `Web IDE` from the edit actions. This requires you to navigate into the source tree where the handbook files are located.

   ![Handbook page at the bottom, action: Edit in Web IDE](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_bottom_handbook_action.png)

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Web IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/):
    - The menu sections are located on the left
    - The explorer section provides the file tree for the project, which is opened automatically when editing a handbook file. (keyboard shortcut: `Shift+Cmd+E`)
    - The editing view is on the right side. On top, there are tabs to organize open files.
    - Additional meta information is provided at the bottom. Git branch, problems, current line number, spaces for indentation, encoding, end-of-line sequence, language mode, layout, notifications.
    - **Tip:** Hover over the menu sections and items to learn more about their purpose and keyboard shortcuts.

    ![Web IDE overview, handbook page highlighted in the file tree](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_file_tree_edit_handbook_page.png)

1. Edit the selected file, and try the Markdown preview. `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS opens the Web IDE command palette to search for commands. For example, type `Markdown`, select `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side` and try the preview.
    - Note that the [handbook markdown engine](/docs/markdown-guide/) supports more rendering features than the [Web IDE preview based on VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown), and some items won't be rendered properly. Commit and create a [draft merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/drafts.html) to view the handbook [review apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/) to preview the page, such as to verify embedded images.

    ![Web IDE editor, Markdown preview](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_console_markdown.png)

1. Upload new files by right-clicking and selecting `Upload...` for example images into `static/images/handbook/` and the corresponding file tree, following the handbook directories.

    ![Web IDE overview, upload files](images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_file_upload_images.png)

1. Open the `Source Control` icon on the left menu which has a blue marker for counting the file changes. Tip: Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+G`.

    ![Web IDE menu, source control](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_menu_explorer_search_source_control.png)

1. Review the changed files, and once ready, specify a Git commit message and click `Commit & Push`. Keyboard shortcut:  `Cmd+Enter`.

    ![Web IDE, commit and push: Commit message](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_source_control_commit_message.png)

1. Commit the changes to a new Git branch (leave selection, press `Enter`).

    ![Web IDE, commit and push: Create a new branch](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_source_control_commit_to_a_new_branch.png)

1. Specify a new Git branch name (optional). Press `Enter` to continue. This action pushes the changes into the Git repository. The changes are persisted on the GitLab server and are immediately visible in the project view.

    ![Web IDE, commit and push: Branch name](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_source_control_commit_new_branch_name.png)

1. Check the pop-up at the bottom right, and click `Create Merge Request` to open the GitLab MR tab. Tip: The notification bell icon at the bottom brings back the notification, if accidentally dismissed.

    ![Web IDE, commit and push: Create Merge Request](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_source_control_popup_create_mr.png)

1. Fill in the MR template, provide why the merge request is created, add labels (e.g. using quick actions `/label ~handbook`), assign yourself (`/assign me`), and set the branch to delete when merged. Optionally, use the [draft option](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/drafts.html) to prevent merging until ready.

    ![GitLab Merge Request view](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_gitlab_create_mr.png)

1. Make additional changes to the MR: Select `Code > Open in Web IDE` on the upper right menu. This opens the Web IDE again to make changes. All changed files are opened automatically.

    ![Merge request, open in Web IDE](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_gitlab_mr_open_in_web_ide.png)

1. Make changes, commit and push them, and select the MR associated branch again (follow [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383801#note_1214559713) for UX commit flows).

    ![Web IDE, commit and select MR associated branch](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_from_mr_changes_source_control_select_branch.png)

1. Optional: Follow the pop-up notification to navigate back to the MR.

    ![Web IDE, go back to MR after commit and push](/handbook/editing-handbook/images/practical_handbook_edits_web_ide_vs_code_from_mr_changes_popup_go_to_mr.png)

**Tip**: Practice the keyboard shortcuts for your workflows: After making changes, `Control+Shift+G` to commit, `Cmd+Enter`, Cursor to select the branch, `Enter`, etc.

**Note:** The `Cmd+w` keyboard shortcut to close a file tab in the Web IDE gets overridden by the Chrome browser to close the browser tab. This is a [known problem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386209), use this shortcut carefully.

### Video: Editing using the Web IDE and single file editor

Note: The video shows the old `www-gitlab-com` project. The editing process, however, is the same.

This video covers:

- Editing the marketing handbook as example
- `Edit this page` action using the Web IDE, overview walkthrough, editing the handbook, again creating a merge request with the same actions.
- Practical handbook edit tips shown in this handbook.

### Historical videos

In these videos, we run through the GitLab Handbook with experts, uncovering how to best use the handbook in our day-to-day work, and learning best-practices for handbook editing along the way. They are meant to be helpful to understand generally how GitLab works, but **the instructions cannot be followed exactly since the editor and repository in GitLab has changed**.

## Editing the handbook locally

If you want to install a local version of the website to test and preview things locally,
see the [handbook project readme](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/tree/main) for instructions on how to set it up.

1. Set up an [SSH key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html) to use with GitLab, if you have not previously done so.
1. [Set up Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html) and clone the appropriate repository, such as the [public handbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook).
1. Use your editor of choice to make changes. If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) optionally along with the [GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/vscode.html), you can follow the [Web IDE editing instructions](#use-the-web-ide-to-edit-the-handbook).
1. [Push the changes to GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#send-changes-to-gitlab).
1. Create a merge request.

Additional notes:

1. We don't need [.gitkeep files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7229885/what-are-the-differences-between-gitignore-and-gitkeep) in our handbook, they make it harder to quickly open a file in editors. Don't add them, and delete them when you see them.

## Team member merge requests being labeled as Community contributions

If you recently created a merge request that was labeled as a Community contribution, you can fix this mislabeling issue going forward by updating the GitLab username in your personal entry in the team member directory to match the GitLab account you use for work.

Use the [team page editing instructions]({{< ref "edit-team-page" >}}) to find your team page entry file, and update the `gitlab` attribute (typically found on line 10) to be an **exact match** for the GitLab.com username you use for work.

## Preview changes on GitLab

To preview your changes:

1. Wait for the pipeline on the merge request to complete.
1. In the pipeline widget on the "Overview" tab of the MR, click on the "View app" button.
1. You may need to navigate to your page by going to any page, then using the left navigation tree. Do not use the search for this.
   - If you prefer to edit the URL, note that the review app uses a `.html` ending, so if your page is `content/handbook/path/to/page.md`, the URL will be `review/app/public/handbook/path/to/path.html`.

## Naming pages and folder structure

The site uses the concept of page bundles, sections, and leaf pages.  A section can have multiple leaf pages, which requires a `_index.md` for the section.  A page bundle is a single page with a group of images, requires an `index.md`.

In general, Handbook URLs should describe their content and be as clean and easy to remember as possible.

Directories (folders) and pages should use lowercase `a-z` and hyphen `-`, except for `_index.md`. Uppercase `A-Z` is allowed but discouraged.
While Git and Hugo allow any UTF-8 character to be used in the file path, using other characters (such as a space) can cause issues with the pipeline.

Section:

```plain
section-dir/
|- _index.md
|- leaf-page1.md
|- leaf-page2.md
```

Page bundle:

```plain
page-name/
|- index.md
|- image1.png
|- image2.png
```

Section with a page bundle:

```plain
section-dir/
|- _index.md
|- leaf-page1.md
|- leaf-page2/
|  |- index.md
|  |- image.pmg
|- leaf-page3.md
```

### Moving, deleting, or renaming a page

If you delete, rename, or move a page, you can:

1. [update all existing links](practical-handbook-edits.md#find-and-replace-a-string-in-all-matching-files)
1. [add an alias to redirect](/docs/frontmatter.md#aliases)

## Editing content from shortcodes

When trying to edit content, you may encounter content that is "built" using [shortcodes](/docs/shortcodes/) and data files.
Shortcodes look similar to `{{` `% performance-indicators "ux_department" %` `}}`.

When you encounter content in a shortcode and want to edit it:

1. Look for the shortcode in the [shortcodes folder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/tree/main/layouts/shortcodes).
   - In the above example, it's `performance-indicators`.
1. At the top of the shortcode file should be a comment on where to look for the relevant data file. Ensure you're using "Display source" to view the file.
   - For example, look in `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/data/performance_indicators` for the `ux_department` file.
   - If there is no comment, you can post in `#handbook` to get help, and make a MR to add it.
1. [Edit the file](#use-the-web-ide-to-edit-the-handbook), being careful to match the existing formatting.

## Troubleshooting

### 404 errors with edit action

When clicking on `Edit this page` in the upper right corner on a handbook page in your browser, you might get a `404` error in the GitLab Web IDE.

As a team member, this problem can be related to an expired SAML session for your GitLab.com profile. In order to mitigate and solve the problem, click on `View page source` to trigger the SAML authentication with Okta again.

Alternatively, navigate into our GitLab.com profile into [your To-Do list](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/todos), or try to open a confidential issue, to trigger the authentication.

It can also be browser related: Try clearing the cache, open an incognito window (on macOS: `cmd shift n`), or use a different browser to test.

### Failing pipelines

To see why your pipeline is failing, there are two main places to look:

1. The latest comment by the bot on your merge request. Mainly covers markdown errors.
1. Individual failed jobs. On the MR > "Pipelines" tab > select any red circle > select a failed job. Error messages are near the bottom of the job log and start with `Error`.

In the job log, error messages typically provide you:

1. the error
1. the file where the error occured
1. the line number
1. the character number (where on the line it is)

For example: `Error: error building site: assemble: "/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/content/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/trust_center_guide.md:1:2": closing tag for shortcode 'details' does not match start tag`

- File: `content/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/trust_center_guide.md`
- Line: 1
- Character: 2

To fix markdown errors, review the message. Alternatively, review the relevant section in the [markdown style guide](/docs/markdown-guide).

For all other errors, the error message should provide the information necessary to fix it.

See the below sections for more details on how to resolves specific types of issues.

If the problem was on the `main` branch, you may need to [rebase](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html#issues-merge-requests-and-epics).

If you're unsure, you can [reach out for help](#need-help).

### Resolving linting errors

To the ensure consistency, quality and correctness of the GitLab Handbook we use various linting jobs that run as part of the pipeline. These jobs check that everything is as it should be, and if they detect something is wrong will cause the pipeline to fail.

### Prettier is formatting markdown files

If you have `prettier` set up in VSCode and it is formatting the `.md` files when they are not supposed to, check if you have Prettier set to be your default formatter with `"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"` in your user settings.

Additionally, consider using the [Glob Pattern](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#GlobPattern) in the extension settings to specify which files to prettify automatically.

### Links and anchors errors

There is a special linter that validates links and anchors across the handbook. If your change accidentally breaks a link, then the pipeline job will fail with a similar error message.

![Link linter error](/handbook/about/images/link-linter-error.png)

1. It is a path to the file where the broken link was detected.
    (filepath - `sites/handbook/source/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/pty-benefits-australia/index.html.md`, line number: 87)
1. It is an error message. An anchor `expense-reimbursement` is defined in the file path from step 1 but does not exist in the file path from step 3.
1. It is a path where the header `Expense Reimbursement` needs to be defined. (file path - `sites/handbook/source/handbook/finance/spending-company-money/index.html.md`)

**How to fix the problem**

Double-check that header `Expense Reimbursement` exists in `sites/handbook/source/handbook/finance/spending-company-money/index.html.md`.

If it was moved or renamed, then update the link with the anchor to point to the correct location.

### Fixing default branch errors

MR pipelines should catch almost all errors before they are merged into the relevant repository.
However, the handbook (and some other projects) pull data from `www-gitlab-com` `yml` files,
which are currently not fully checked by the pipeline.

If the default branch `main` (for public and internal handbook) or `master` (for `www-gitlab-com`)
is "broken" and pipelines are failing for everyone, the root issue is most likely a data file error.

1. Check the error message.
1. If it mentions an error in building the site, or rendering something, follow the trace.
1. In the layout file, if it's failing on displaying on something
   that starts with `site.Data.public.`, then it's a data file issue.
1. There are two ways to fix. Either:
   1. Make the code itself more robust to deal with the types of values it may encounter.
      However, not everyone knows Go and Hugo well enough to do that quickly.
      If needed, create a "Handbook::Operations" "type::bug" issue in the handbook repository to document the problem
      after fixing the pipeline issue.
   1. Edit the data file to have values the build won't fail on.

#### Example: Fixing broken main on tech writing shortcode

Take this [example error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/jobs/5968799321#L123):

```plain
Error: error building site: failed to render shortcode: "/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/content/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/_index.md:126:1": failed to render shortcode "tech-writing": failed to process shortcode: "/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/layouts/shortcodes/tech-writing.html:16:28": execute of template failed: template: shortcodes/tech-writing.html:16:28: executing "shortcodes/tech-writing.html" at <ref page (printf "/handbook/product/categories#%s-section" $section)>: error calling ref: parse "/handbook/product/categories#%!s(<nil>)-section": invalid URL escape "%!s"
```

Following the error trace, notice that the last error with a full path and line number is:
`failed to process shortcode: "/builds/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/layouts/shortcodes/tech-writing.html:16:28"`.

Looking [at the file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/blob/114d8f9bf00342360be14dce8cf6e55e1d8a6edd/layouts/shortcodes/tech-writing.html#L16),
the issue is an unexpected value in `printf "/handbook/product/categories#%s-section" $section`,
which matches the last part of the error message.

From there, [line 11](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/blob/114d8f9bf00342360be14dce8cf6e55e1d8a6edd/layouts/shortcodes/tech-writing.html#L11)
tells us that the data is from `site.Data.public.stages.stages "section"`.

If you have a local build of the site, you can find all the data files in the `data/public` folder.
The relevant file (usually a `yml` file) should tell you at the top where to find the original.

If you do not have a local build, you can still likely find it in the [www-gitlab-com data folder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/data).

Based on the code, you can figure out the filename. `site.Data.public.stages.stages` means it's
in `data/public` and the file is `stages.yml`.

The last parts `.stages "section"` means it's inside of `stages:` and it's pulling data from
each `section:` line.

You can check the most recent changes to the file, and/or compare it to when `main` started failing.

In this case, [an empty `section:` line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/commit/17a5406b9a8fd33756cd5e0c4a2343ea2b4ab7a7)
was the issue.

The quick and easy fix is to add text to the empty `section:` line, merge it, and run a new pipeline
in the public handbook project.

In this case, [the handbook code was made more robust](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/merge_requests/2820/diffs).
