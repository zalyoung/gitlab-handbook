## We believe in Open Source

As a company, GitLab is dedicated to open source. Not only do we believe in it, but we use it, and we give back to it. Not just through GitLab, but through contributions to other open source projects.

The purpose of this page is to document how a GitLab employee can:

- Create an open source project on behalf of GitLab
- Contribute to a third-party open source project on behalf of GitLab
- Use a third-party open source code in a GitLab's project

## Growth Strategy

As an open source project, we want to stay healthy and be open for growth, but also ready to accommodate a 10x factor of
our community. In order to achieve that, we've [outlined a strategy](growth-strategy.html) that is a collaboration between multiple departments.

## Creating an open source project

See [Creating a new project](../gitlab-repositories/#creating-a-new-project) for the instructions.

## Contributing to a third-party project on behalf of GitLab

### Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)

If you're contributing to an open source project on behalf of GitLab, you may be required to enter into a CLA.

- In accordance with the [Authorization Matrix Policy](/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix-policy), Legal approval is required in order for you to enter into a CLA on behalf of GitLab.
- Visit the [Legal & Corporate Affairs Product handbook](/handbook/legal/product/#contributor-license-agreements) for further information on this process.

### Contributing to a project on GitHub

If your GitHub account's primary email is not your @gitlab.com email, you can add it as an additional address. No need to create a separate account.

1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to into your account
2. Follow the usual [pull request flow](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

In the future, we might have a single organization for forks. That will allow us to track various metrics about contributions made by GitLab employees.

## Using open source software

The guidance for using open source software, including details of which licenses are pre-approved for use, is now available in the [Legal & Corporate Affairs handbook](/handbook/legal/product/#using-open-source-software).

## Using forks in your code

Avoid using forked code and try to contribute your change upstream.

It's typical for forks to fall far behind the upstream repository and such dependencies become a source of pain:

- Rebasing the branch may become non-trivial and it'd become hard to bring such dependency up to date.
- Some other library in your project might depend on the original version, creating a [diamond dependency problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

There may be good reasons to create a fork:

- To fix a security issue that is not being fixed upstream fast enough if it's affecting us or our customers
- Any other reasons? Talk to your peers and use your best judgement.

If you decide to create a fork, make sure you open an issue that:

- Describes the reason for the fork to exist
- Links to the MR(s) where the fork was introduced as a dependency
- Links to any relevant issues in the upstream project. If the issue was not reported already, make sure you report it in the project's issue tracker. This is important because if the project's maintainers don't know about it they will not fix it
- Links to any opened MRs/PRs to fix the issue upstream
- Describes the remediation work needed to start using the upstream code again
- If it's not just changes in the forked code, but also some modifications in your code to use the fork, consider putting a TODO and a link to this issue next to that code in a comment

## GPL Cooperation Commitment

Visit the [Legal & Corporate Affairs Product handbook](/handbook/legal/product/#gpl-cooperation-commitment) for further information on this.

## Sponsoring open-source projects 

At GitLab we are committed to open-source. There may be a case to consider sponsoring an open-source project or project maintainer from a business continuity perspective. In such cases, GitLab may want to become a vested member of said project by either:

- Contributing upstream and/or sponsoring the project maintainer(s)
- Becoming a maintainer for the project, or
- With the agreement of the original author(s), adopting the project to continue development and maintenance

### Becoming a maintainer in an open source project 

For GitLab to become a maintainer in a project, review the guidelines in [contributing to open source](/handbook/company/stewardship/#how-we-think-about-contributing-more-to-open-source). 

### Contributing upstream to an open source project 

A business case must be established for GitLab to commit to sponsoring and providing finanical support to an open source project. Budgets for open source project and support models will be allocated from Engineering. 

The steps for establishing a business case for an open source project outlined below: 

1. Create a confidential [new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new) in GitLab.org using the Problem Validation Template
1. Title the issue - "Business Case: Open Source Sponsorship for Project X" 
1. Fill in the details leveraging the RICE scoring of expected impact of the Open Source Sponsorship, also include the estimated cost of the Sponsorship 
1. As an optional task, you can make a copy of the [Opportunity Canvas template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTEMcwH10xWilQEnVc65oC6PdC3VMjn2XoARfNTaHkc/edit#heading=h.4mt5fmtn0ax4) to further illustrate the impact this sponsorship will have on the business. Link in the issue proposal 
1. Tag in the issue the Director of Engineering, Director of Product, Director of Contributor Success for review and approval
