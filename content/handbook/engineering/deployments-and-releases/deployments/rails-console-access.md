## Policy on Rails Console Usage in Production and Staging

### Purpose

To ensure the stability, security, and auditability of GitLab by:

1. Reducing reliance on manual changes that can mask broken or missing product features
2. Minimizing the use of arbitrary code execution to accomplish routine tasks
3. Mitigating risks associated with far-reaching console access and improving auditability
4. Promoting the use of safer change methods such as version-controlled code deployments and feature flags
5. Encouraging the development and use of product features for routine operations
6. Enhancing overall system reliability by standardizing change processes

### Scope

This policy applies to all GitLab deployment environments such as GitLab.com and Dedicated and to all users in those environments

### Policy

Access to the [GitLab Rails Console](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/rails_console.html) is intended as a measure of last resort. 

1. Read-only rails console permissions are appropriate for critical debugging scenarios where no alternative method is available
2. Making changes through the rails console is prohibited
3. All production changes must be implemented through version-controlled code deployments or chatops. This ensures that those changes are traceable, reproducible, and testable.

### Exceptions to this policy

In some exceptional scenarios, such as critical production outages impacting customers, temporary authorization to make changes via the rails console may be requested. Approval can be obtained from any Engineering Manager in the Infrastructure Platforms department. If you are in an incident, approval can also be obtained from the current EOC or IM.

If the Rails console commands are intended to be executed through the Support team, they must first be approved by a Support Manager. This ensures a shared understanding of the code being executed and the specific scenarios in which it will be applied.

After the immediate need has passed, actions taken in the console should be translated into code changes and deployed through the standard release process to ensure a permanent and auditable fix.
