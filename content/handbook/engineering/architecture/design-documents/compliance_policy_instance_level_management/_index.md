## Introduction

Compliance frameworks and security policies are currently managed at the group level, which creates challenges for organizations that need to apply consistent compliance and security requirements across multiple groups. This document outlines a proposed architecture to implement Instance Level Compliance and Policy Management functionality using a designated Compliance and Security Policy (CSP) Group approach, allowing organizations to centrally manage and consistently apply compliance frameworks and security policies across the entire instance.

Refer to [Instance Level Compliance and Policy Management](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/15864) epic for product requirements.

## Proposal

We propose designating a top-level group as the central authority for compliance frameworks and security policies at the instance level. This CSP Group will contain the centrally managed frameworks and policies, which will then be applied to other groups throughout the instance. Top-level group owners can apply these frameworks to their projects but cannot modify them, ensuring consistent application of compliance and security requirements.

## Goals

- Allow the application of compliance frameworks and security policies across multiple top-level groups from a central location.
- Enable compliance and security professionals to enforce common requirements across an organization's projects.
- Improve separation of duties for compliance and security management, such as granting only Admin users the ability to designate a CSP group and the users who may manage those policies.
- Simplify the user experience of centralized compliance and policy management by removing the requirement to manage security policy project (SPP) links across groups to a centralized SPP.
- Reduce the need for complex scripting to maintain consistent compliance frameworks across groups.
- Allow for top-level groups to manage policies within their own group while also enabling enforcement of centralized policies across all top-level groups.
- Create a design that can easily evolve when Organization-level scoping becomes available.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing existing group-level compliance framework or security policy functionality.
- Building Organization-level management in this phase (though we aim to design for future compatibility).
- Creating new compliance framework types or security policy types.
- Changing the underlying policy evaluation engine.

## Terminology/Glossary

- **CSP Group**: Compliance and Security Policy Group - a designated top-level group with elevated permissions for centrally managing compliance and security policies.
- **Framework-scoped Policy**: A security policy that targets specific compliance frameworks.
- **Instance Level**: Functionality that applies across the entire GitLab instance.

## Design Overview

### Core Approach

1. Instance administrator designates a top-level group as the CSP Group.
2. CSP Group admins create compliance frameworks and security policies.
3. Compliance frameworks are automatically applied to all other top-level groups in the instance.
4. Security policies are scoped to compliance frameworks.
5. Projects in any group can use the CSP Group's frameworks.
6. When a project with an assoicated framework from the CSP Group runs a pipeline, it enforces the associated policies.

## Data Model

### Tables

**application_settings**

```sql
ALTER TABLE application_settings
ADD COLUMN csp_namespace_id BIGINT REFERENCES namespaces(id);
```

### Modified Tables

**compliance_framework_security_policies**

```sql
ALTER TABLE compliance_framework_security_policies
ADD COLUMN is_from_csp_group BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
```

## Core Workflows

### CSP Group Designation

1. Instance administrator navigates to `Admin Area > Settings > Security and compliance`.
2. Administrator selects a top-level group to designate as the CSP Group.
3. System creates an entry in the `application_settings` table.
4. UI updates to show special indicators for the CSP Group.
5. Generate an instance audit event tracking creation, modification, and deletion of CSP Group Designations.

### Compliance Framework Creation

1. CSP Group admin creates a compliance framework in the CSP Group.
2. System automatically associated this framework with all other top-level groups.

### Security Policy Management

1. CSP Group admin creates security policies in the policy project (`.gitlab/security-policies/policy.yml`)
2. Admin scopes policies to specific compliance frameworks
3. System creates entries in `compliance_framework_security_policies` with `is_from_csp_group = true`

The CSP Group approach supports all security policy types, including scan execution policies, merge request approval policies, and vulnerability management policies. Each policy type follows the same scoping mechanism but has different configuration parameters and enforcement behaviors. Below are examples of different policy types:

#### Scan execution policy example

```yaml
scan_execution_policy:
  name: Block vulnerable dependencies
  description: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies
  enabled: true
  rules:
  - type: pipeline
    branches:
    - release/*
  actions:
  - scan: sast
  policy_scope:
    csp_compliance_frameworks: # CSP compliance framework
      - id: 1
```

#### Merge request approval policy example

```yaml
merge_request_approval_policy:
  name: Security approval for production code changes
  description: Require security team approval for changes to production code
  enabled: true
  rules:
  - type: merge_request
    branches:
    - main
    - production/*
  approvals_required: 1
  user_approvers:
    - security-team
  policy_scope:
    csp_compliance_frameworks: # CSP compliance framework
      - id: 1
      - id: 3
```

#### Vulnerability management policy example

```yaml
vulnerability_management_policy:
  name: Critical vulnerability remediation policy
  description: Sets timelines for addressing critical vulnerabilities
  enabled: true
  rules:
  - type: vulnerability
    severity: critical
  actions:
  - issue_creation:
      due_date: 7 # days
      assignee: vulnerability_author
  policy_scope:
    csp_compliance_frameworks: # CSP compliance framework
      - id: 2
```

Each policy type follows its specific workflow for enforcement:

- Scan execution policies are enforced during CI/CD pipeline execution
- Merge request approval policies are enforced at merge request creation and update
- Vulnerability management policies are triggered when vulnerabilities are detected

### Project Compliance Framework Assignment

1. Group owner can assign CSP frameworks to projects.
2. Group owner can set CSP frameworks as default for new projects.
3. System creates entries in `project_compliance_framework_settings` referencing the framework.

### Policy Enforcement in CI/CD Pipeline

1. When a project pipeline runs, system checks for assigned compliance frameworks.
2. System retrieves all security policies scoped to the framework.
3. Policies are enforced against the project's pipeline.

### CSP Group Change Management

#### Changing CSP Group Designation

1. Instance administrator navigates to `Admin Area > Settings > Security and compliance`.
2. Administrator selects a different top-level group to designate as the new CSP Group.
3. System displays a confirmation dialog with impact information.
4. Upon confirmation:
   a. System updates the entry in `application_settings` table.
   b. Previous frameworks from the old CSP Group are no longer visible or applied.
   c. All previous frameworks from the old CSP Group are no longer visible for projects.
   d. All security policies linked to the old CSP Group are unlinked.
   e. New frameworks from the new CSP Group are visible to all top-level groups.
   f. System generates an audit event tracking the CSP Group change.
5. UI indicators update to reflect the new CSP Group.

#### Removing CSP Group Designation

1. Instance administrator navigates to `Admin Area > Settings > Security and compliance`.
2. Administrator selects "Remove CSP Group designation".
3. System displays a confirmation dialog with impact information.
4. Upon confirmation:
   a. System removes the entry from `application_settings` table.
   b. All previous frameworks from the old CSP Group are no longer visible for projects.
   c. All security policies linked to the old CSP Group are unlinked.
   d. System generates an audit event tracking the CSP Group removal.
5. UI indicators are removed to reflect the absence of a CSP Group.

### Compliance Framework Change Management

#### Modifying a Compliance Framework in CSP Group

1. CSP Group admin edits a compliance framework in the CSP Group.
2. System generates an audit event for the update.
3. The updated framework's changes are reflected automatically for each top-level group.
4. UI updates to show the updated framework information across all groups.

#### Deleting a Compliance Framework in CSP Group

1. CSP Group admin deletes a compliance framework in the CSP Group.
2. System displays a confirmation dialog with impact information.
3. Upon confirmation:
   a. System marks the framework as deleted in the database.
   b. System generates audit events for each deletion.
   c. The deleted framework is no longer visible for projects.

#### Associating frameworks from the CSP Group

All frameworks created in the CSP Group will automatically be assoicated to all other top-level groups, so that when frameworks are retrieved for a given top-level group, all the group's frameworks as well as all the CSP Group's frameworks will be returned. This in turn will be used to ensure project settings are updated to reflect each association to the CSP Group.

### Security Policy Change Management

#### Modifying a Security Policy in CSP Group

1. CSP Group admin edits a security policy in the policy project.
1. System updates the policy yaml.
1. Changes take effect immediately for all projects using frameworks associated with that policy.
1. No action is needed on mirrored frameworks as policy enforcement looks up the original framework.
1. System generates an audit event tracking the policy change.

#### Removing a Security Policy in CSP Group

1. CSP Group admin removes a security policy from the policy project.
1. System updates the policy configuration.
1. Policy is immediately removed from enforcement across all projects.
1. System generates an audit event tracking the policy removal.

### Top-Level Group Management

#### Adding a New Top-Level Group

1. User creates a new top-level group.
2. Group owners can immediately assign any of the frameworks to projects.

#### Deleting a Top-Level Group

1. User deletes a top-level group.
2. System performs standard group deletion operations.
3. No special handling is needed beyond standard group deletion.

## API Design

### GraphQL Extensions

```graphql
type Query {
  instanceCspGroup: Namespace

  isCspGroup: Boolean!
}

extend type Project {
  assignedFrameworks: [ComplianceManagementFramework!]!
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Models and Associations

These models define the structure of the compliance framework mirroring system.

#### ComplianceManagementFramework

- This model represents a compliance framework, which consists of a set of security policies, requirements, and rules that organizations must follow.
- Defines compliance frameworks that belong to a namespace (group).
- Establishes relationships with:
  - CSP Group's frameworks
  - Compliance framework security policies (for applying security policies)
  - Security policies (via `compliance_framework_security_policies`).
- Defines a scopes:
  - `csp_frameworks`: filters frameworks that are designated as CSP frameworks.
  - `frameworks_from_csp`: filters frameworks that are from the CSP Group.
  - `frameworks`: filters frameworks that are not from the CSP Group.

### Services

#### CSP::PolicyResolverService

- Provides a way to resolve and return policies that apply to a specific project.
- Retrieves policies for a given project and returns them as a structured response.

### Controllers

Controllers expose API endpoints for managing the CSP group configuration.

#### API::V4::Instance::CspGroupController

- Provides an API to retrieve and update the CSP group that holds the source compliance frameworks.
- Authentication & Authorization
  - Requires user authentication.
  - Ensures only admins can update the CSP group.
- Show Action
  - Retrieves and returns the CSP group namespace ID.
- Update Action
  - Updates the CSP group namespace in InstanceSettings.
  - Returns a success response.

## Future Considerations

### Extended Capabilities
