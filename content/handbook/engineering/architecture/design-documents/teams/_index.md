## Summary

GitLab's current access control model conflates user management with project organization through the dual-purpose nature of groups. While the upcoming [Organizations](../organization/_index.md) will provide customer isolation and address some enterprise-scale challenges, it does not resolve the fundamental dual-purpose nature of groups within each Organization. This creates significant challenges for enterprise customers who need to separate organizational structure from resource management while maintaining security and compliance requirements within their customer boundaries.

This blueprint defines the architectural requirements for a Teams-based access control system that operates within Organization boundaries, separates user management from project organization, addresses critical customer pain points, and positions GitLab competitively in the enterprise DevOps market.

The Teams architecture aims to introduce a distinct entity for managing users that can be shared across groups and projects within Organizations, providing clearer mental models, better inheritance behavior, and reduced administrative overhead. This separation addresses [the #1 vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 (Broken Access Control)](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/) while reducing the cognitive load for users of the current system.

## Motivation

### Current State Analysis

In GitLab, groups serve dual purposes that create inherent tension:

1. **Project organization**: Hierarchical structure for managing code, issues, and CI/CD resources
2. **User management**: Organizing people and controlling access to resources

While the upcoming Organizations feature will provide customer isolation and address some enterprise-scale challenges, it does not resolve the fundamental dual-purpose nature of groups within each Organization. Organizations will contain groups, but those groups will still face the same access management and organizational modeling challenges that exist today.

This dual nature creates several critical problems identified through customer research and competitive analysis:

**Permission management complexity**: Nearly every customer interview mentioned challenges with GitLab's permission model, particularly around inheritance creating unexpected access levels when users have different roles at different hierarchy levels. While GitLab's custom roles provide fine-grained permission control with over 40 specific permissions, complexity arises from how these permissions interact with the dual-purpose nature of groups and the resulting inheritance patterns.

**Inconsistent sharing behavior**: Group sharing exhibits different inheritance patterns depending on the target (group vs project). Sharing a group with another group only shares direct members, while sharing a group with a project includes both direct and inherited members. This inconsistency violates user mental models and creates security risks.

**Cognitive load and mental model mismatch**: Users expect permissions to work like physical filing cabinets — explicit and visible. The current invisible inheritance model violates these expectations, leading to systematic errors and security vulnerabilities as users work around systems they don't understand.

### Relationship to Organizations and Architectural Approach

The Teams architecture operates within the [Organization](../organization/_index.md) framework currently under development. While Organizations provide customer isolation and administrative boundaries, they do not solve the fundamental access management challenges within each customer's boundary: complex permission inheritance, difficulty separating user management from project organization, and administrative overhead for cross-functional collaboration.
Teams complement Organizations by providing the "who does the work" layer while Organizations provide the "customer isolation" layer, enabling cross-group collaboration within customer boundaries without breaking isolation between customers.

#### Architectural Philosophy: Hybrid vs. Restructuring Approach

During design, significant discussion emerged about pursuing radical architectural restructuring (flattening GitLab's hierarchy entirely, separating groups into distinct systems for Access, Settings, Aggregation, Features, Relationships) versus a more incremental hybrid approach.
The radical restructuring approach would eliminate groups entirely, providing maximum architectural flexibility and clean separation of concerns. However, this presents substantial challenges:

- **Engineering risks**: Performance impact from removing hierarchical inheritance, migration complexity requiring vast code rewrites, database restructuring, and breaking thousands of existing integrations
- **Customer risks**: Namespace collisions, disruption to enterprise compliance boundaries, operational disruption for 100,000+ organizations, and retraining costs for millions of users

The hybrid approach adopted preserves groups for organizational hierarchy and namespace management while adding Teams specifically for access management and work coordination. This approach:

- Maintains backwards compatibility while solving immediate customer problems
- Provides clear separation: Organizations = "Customer isolation", Groups = "Where work lives", Teams = "Who does the work"
- Represents a "two-way door" decision enabling evolution based on real usage data rather than theoretical models

Industry evolution since 2023 validates this approach, with major platforms successfully implementing Teams as complementary layers rather than replacing existing organizational structures.

### Industry Context and Competitive Pressure

Research across the DevOps landscape reveals that access management inefficiencies cost US companies approximately $61 billion annually, with 94% of applications showing some form of broken access control. The competitive landscape has evolved significantly, with major platforms implementing sophisticated approaches to address enterprise access management challenges:

- **Team-based hierarchical models** with sophisticated nesting and clear inheritance patterns
- **Organizational structure separation** from project management through dedicated organizational modeling features
- **Project-level permission cascading** that eliminates individual resource permission management overhead
- **Clear separation patterns** between permanent user organization and temporary access mechanisms

These evolved approaches demonstrate industry recognition that traditional access control models are insufficient for modern enterprise DevOps requirements. GitLab's current dual-purpose group model increasingly appears dated compared to these specialized solutions, potentially limiting enterprise adoption and competitive positioning.

### Relationship to Existing Systems

#### Integration with Custom Roles

The existing custom roles system addresses permission granularity through 40+ specific permissions. Teams will complement this:

- Custom Roles: Define what users can do (specific capabilities)
- Teams: Define which users should have access and how that access is organized within Organizations
- Combined System: Enable modeling organizational structure while maintaining precise permission control

#### Integration with Organizations

- Teams operate entirely within Organization boundaries, never crossing customer isolation
- Organization owners can manage Teams within their Organization
- Teams inherit the security and compliance characteristics of their containing Organization
- Enterprise identity integration occurs at the Organization level, with Teams providing internal structure

#### Integration with Groups and Projects

- Groups continue to provide namespace management, settings inheritance, and project organization
- Teams provide the access management and user organization layer
- Projects remain the fundamental unit of work, accessible through both Group hierarchy and Team membership

### Non-Goals

1. **Replacement of groups or radical architectural restructuring**
   - Teams are designed to complement groups, not replace them
   - Groups will continue to provide namespace management, settings inheritance, and project organization
   - We explicitly avoid a "one-way door" decision that would require rewriting vast portions of the system
   - Focus remains on solving access management problems while preserving organizational hierarchy benefits

2. **Replacement of existing permission systems**
   - Teams architecture should complement, not replace, the existing custom roles and permissions system
   - Teams should provide organizational structure and inheritance patterns for applying existing permission models

3. **Immediate disruption of existing workflows**
   - Current group functionality must remain fully supported during and after Teams implementation
   - Existing customer workflows cannot be disrupted without explicit migration path
   - API compatibility must be maintained to avoid breaking existing integrations

4. **Over-engineering organizational complexity**
   - Focus on common enterprise organizational patterns rather than edge cases within Organizations
   - Maintain philosophy of convention over configuration
   - Avoid creating complexity that contradicts the goal of reducing cognitive load

### Engineering Feasibility and Technical Considerations

**Performance and compatibility**

- Teams must integrate with existing hierarchical permission lookup patterns without performance degradation
- Database schema must follow established patterns (organization_id, namespace_id, project_id) and support existing partitioning strategies
- All existing API endpoints and CI/CD pipelines must continue functioning unchanged
- New Teams APIs must follow established authentication and authorization patterns

**Gradual adoption strategy**

- Teams functionality must be purely additive — overlaying on existing group hierarchies without requiring data migration
- Mixed environments (Teams + traditional groups) must be supported indefinitely
- Customers can adopt Teams incrementally without disrupting existing workflows
- Rollback capabilities must be available if Teams adoption creates issues

**Organization integration**

- All Teams functionality must respect Organization isolation boundaries — no cross-Organization sharing or visibility
- Organization owners must have full administrative control over Teams within their Organization
- Teams must integrate with Organization-level identity provider synchronization and audit trails
- Teams settings and policies must be configurable at the Organization level for compliance requirements

## Open Questions and Research Areas

### Teams and Organization Integration Patterns

**Organization-scoped Team management:**

- Should Teams be created at the Organization level and then shared with groups/projects, or created within groups and promoted to Organization-level?
- How should Team membership synchronization with external identity providers work within Organization boundaries?
- What administrative controls should Organization owners have over Teams created by Group owners within their Organization?

**Cross-group Team collaboration:**

- How should Teams spanning multiple groups within an Organization handle different group visibility levels (private/internal/public)?
- Should Teams inherit the most restrictive visibility settings from their constituent Groups, or should Teams have independent visibility controls?
- How do we handle Teams that need access to Groups with different compliance frameworks within the same Organization?

### Hierarchical vs Flat Team Structure Decision

**Hierarchical approach benefits:**

- Natural mapping to organizational structure reduces cognitive load
- Inheritance patterns simplify administration at scale
- Aligns with existing GitLab group hierarchy mental models
- Supports enterprise compliance requirements for clear access paths

**Hierarchical approach challenges:**

- Deep nesting creates performance and usability problems (as seen in other enterprise platforms)
- Inheritance complexity can lead to unintended access (security risk)
- Organizational changes require structural modifications
- May not support matrix organizations or cross-functional teams effectively

**Research Questions:**

- Can a hybrid approach provide hierarchical benefits within Organizations without complex inheritance?
- Should Teams have parent-child relationships for organizational modeling without automatic permission inheritance?
- How do enterprise customers expect Teams to mirror their internal organizational structure?

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Custom roles and Teams interaction:**

- How should custom roles assigned to Teams interact with custom roles assigned directly to users?
- Should Teams be able to have different custom roles in different contexts (Group A vs Project B)?
- How do we handle conflicts when a user belongs to multiple Teams with different custom role assignments?

**Group sharing and Teams:**

- Should Teams be shareable with Groups in the same way Groups can be shared with other Groups?
- How should Teams sharing interact with existing Group sharing inheritance patterns?
- Should sharing a Team with a Group automatically grant the Team's role to all shared contexts?

## Alternative Solutions Analysis

### Option 1: Enhance Current Group Model

**Approach:** Improve existing groups to better separate user management concerns through enhanced sharing options and visibility improvements.

**Pros:**

- Minimal disruption to existing customers and workflows
- Leverages existing user familiarity with group concepts
- Lower development and migration costs
- Maintains current API compatibility

**Cons:**

- Doesn't address fundamental dual-purpose nature of groups
- Inheritance inconsistencies would persist
- Limited ability to implement enterprise-scale requirements
- Doesn't provide clear separation for compliance frameworks
- May not be sufficient to compete with evolved industry offerings

### Option 2: Complete Architectural Restructuring (Flat Structure)

**Approach:** Eliminate groups entirely within Organizations, implementing a flat structure with specialized systems for Access, Settings, Aggregation, Features, and Relationships.

**Pros:**

- Maximum architectural flexibility and clean separation of concerns
- Eliminate all inheritance complexity
- Align with theoretical ideals about system design
- Could provide ultimate solution to dual-purpose problems

**Cons:**

- Namespace collisions: Flat structures reduce available naming cardinality significantly
- Enterprise disruption: Many organizations use group boundaries for SOX/GDPR compliance
- API compatibility: Would break thousands of existing integrations and CI/CD pipelines
- One-way door: Irreversible decision with significant risk if the approach proves problematic

### Option 3: Teams as Hybrid Solution Within Organizations

**Approach:** Implement Teams as a complementary layer within Organizations that provides access management and work coordination while preserving groups for organizational hierarchy.

**Pros:**

- Two-way door decision: Can gather customer feedback and evolve based on real usage patterns
- Backwards compatibility: Preserves existing workflows and integrations
- Clear mental models: Groups = "Where work lives", Teams = "Who does the work", Organizations = "Customer isolation"
- Engineering feasibility: Builds on existing architecture rather than requiring complete rewrite
- Customer value: Addresses immediate pain points while enabling future evolution
- Industry validation: Aligns with successful approaches taken by other major platforms

**Cons:**

- More complex than pure flat structure in some theoretical aspects
