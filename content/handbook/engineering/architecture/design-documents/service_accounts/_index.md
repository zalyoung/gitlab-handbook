<!--
Before you start:

- Copy this file to a sub-directory and call it `_index.md` for it to appear in
  the design documents list.
- Remove comment blocks for sections you've filled in.
  When your document ready for review, all of these comment blocks should be
  removed.

To get started with a document you can use this template to inform you about
what you may want to document in it at the beginning. This content will change
/ evolve as you move forward with the proposal.  You are not constrained by the
content in this template. If you have a good idea about what should be in your
document, you can ignore the template, but if you don't know yet what should
be in it, this template might be handy.

- **Fill out this file as best you can.** At minimum, you should fill in the
  "Summary", and "Motivation" sections.  These can be brief and may be a copy
  of issue or epic descriptions if the initiative is already on Product's
  roadmap.
- **Create a MR for this document.** Assign it to an Architecture Evolution
  Coach (i.e. a Principal+ engineer).
- **Merge early and iterate.** Avoid getting hung up on specific details and
  instead aim to get the goals of the document clarified and merged quickly.
  The best way to do this is to just start with the high-level sections and fill
  out details incrementally in subsequent MRs.

Just because a document is merged does not mean it is complete or approved.
Any document is a working document and subject to change at any time.

When editing documents, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic MRs to keep
discussions focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a
new MR with suggested changes.

If there are new details that belong in the document, edit the document. Once
a feature has become "implemented", major changes should get new blueprints.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is

Document statuses you can use:

## Summary

GitLab currently supports more than 10 different bot user account types, each managed by different teams with inconsistent permission policies and authentication methods. This fragmentation creates challenges in ownership clarity, potential security vulnerabilities, customer visibility issues, and significant maintenance overhead. This proposal establishes service accounts as the core machine identity. Service accounts provide capabilities similar to regular users while enforcing important security constraints like UI sign-in restrictions and implementing streamlined permission policies. As part of this excercise, we would also need to ensure service accounts can be introduced on the free tier of GitLab with appropriate abuse prevention controls.

## Motivation

A consolidated approach to machine identities through service accounts will:

- Simplify GitLab's machine access story by providing a unified interface and code path
- Enhance security through consistent authentication methods and access controls
- Reduce engineering overhead by centralizing bot-related code and policies
- Improve customer experience by allowing management of machine identities alongside other users
- Establish clear ownership and responsibility for machine identities
- Create proper isolation between human users and machine identities to facilitate easier ownership transfer and management.

### Goals

1. Enhance service accounts with features to support all required use-cases (e.g., project/group allow lists)
1. Standardize on service accounts for all new machine identities
1. Create migration paths for existing bot user types
1. Simplify permission policies for machine identities
1. Develop a revised monetization strategy for service accounts in collaboration with product teams
2. Bring service accounts to GitLab Free tier with appropriate abuse prevention controls

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is,
but keep it simple!  This should have enough detail that reviewers can
understand exactly what you're proposing, but should not include things like
API designs or implementation. The "Design Details" section below is for the
real nitty-gritty.

You might want to consider including the pros and cons of the proposed solution so that they can be
compared with the pros and cons of alternatives.
-->

## Design and implementation details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

If you are not sure how many implementation details you should include in the
document, the rule of thumb here is to provide enough context for people to
understand the proposal. As you move forward with the implementation, you may
need to add more implementation details to the document, as those may become
valuable context for important technical decisions made along the way. A
document is also a register of such technical decisions. If a technical
decision requires additional context before it can be made, you probably should
document this context in a document. If it is a small technical decision that
can be made in a merge request by an author and a maintainer, you probably do
not need to document it here. The impact a technical decision will have is
another helpful information - if a technical decision is very impactful,
documenting it, along with associated implementation details, is advisable.

If it's helpful to include workflow diagrams or any other related images.
Diagrams authored in GitLab flavored markdown are preferred. In cases where
that is not feasible, images should be placed under `images/` in the same
directory as the `index.md` for the proposal.

## Alternative Solutions

<!--
It might be a good idea to include a list of alternative solutions or paths considered, although it is not required. Include pros and cons for
each alternative solution/path.

"Do nothing" and its pros and cons could be included in the list too.
