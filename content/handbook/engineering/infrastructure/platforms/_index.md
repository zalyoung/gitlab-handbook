title: "The Infrastructure Platforms Section"
---

## Mission

The Infrastructure Platforms section enables GitLab Engineering to build and deliver **safe**, **scalable** and **efficient** features for multi-tenant and single-tenant GitLab SaaS platforms (GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated).

## Vision

To deliver on the mission, we are in the process of formalising the building blocks we need to work on.

## Direction

In FY25, teams in the Platforms Section of the Infrastructure Department have collaborated on [the "North Star"](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/1097), which is then used to set [the SaaS Platforms Strategy](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2243).

Initiatives driven within the Platforms section, often spanning multiple quarters, are represented on the [SaaS Platforms section epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2115).

## How we work

### Communication

#### Slack

Our main method of communication is Slack.

The SaaS Platforms group is gradually directing requests for help to the [#saas-platforms-help](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07DU5Z7V6V) Slack channel.
This channel can be used if it is unclear which Infrastructure team the question should be directed to.
For more information, refer to the [landing page for getting assistance](../getting-assistance). 

The [#saas-platforms-help](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07DU5Z7V6V) channel is monitored by SaaS Platforms Engineering Managers and Staff+ engineers who triage any inbound requests. When triaging this channel, one should locate the team who can best answer this question and instruct the requestor to contact that team using the team's preferred contact method. When the requestor is connected to the right team, add a green check emoji to the message. Finally, if needed, update the [getting assistance](./getting-assistance)] page with any changes.

#### Meetings

Once per week, we hold a `Platforms leads call` to align on action items related to career development, general direction or answer any ongoing questions that have not been addressed async. The call is cancelled when there are no topics added on the morning of the call.

In addition to the `Platforms leads call`, we have some recurring events and reminders that can be viewed in the [SaaS Platforms Leadership Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_8a81f7acc76d72b8e4189a61f7a259b9d722e3fe1e05693236f592e7dd52e83b%40group.calendar.google.com). Please add this to your Calendars to stay up-to-date with the various events.

The Director of Product and Director of Infrastructure for SaaS Platforms conduct weekly progress reviews. During `Platforms Grand Review`, they review [progress across all groups](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/2115) with the goals of being informed of progress made, learning about existing blockers, and supporting the team. The review is private streamed to the GitLab Unfiltered channel because the review covers confidential issues. All recordings are made available in the [Platforms Grand Review YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KqDXSHdlUvPWHOj_Hw8JdQ1).

##### Infrastructure Platforms Leads Demo

The Infrastructure Platforms Leads Demo is an opportunity for sync discussions between Staff+ IC across the Infrastructure Platforms Group to highlight current ongoing efforts underway in the teams they support.
All team members are welcome to join the call, but the emphasis is on Staff+ ICs to present and discuss the work they're focused on, the problems they're experiencing, and solutions they're considering.

The call is recorded to the [Infrastructure Platforms Leads Demo Unfiltered Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KpI98ZtrhYrA_gJgYJjnOgl). The agenda can be found in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MX__hMUcxEUv2JlRiXySNvFnOPHv7-Uul1_VbzImbKw/edit).

While the intention is for the call to be made public on GitLab Unfiltered, the default is for it to be published as private.
At the end of the call, a quick vote is held between the attendees and if all agree that the content is #SAFE, it can be published as public.

### Slack to GitLab Issue Tracker Integration

In an effort to enhance the tracking and resolution of requests directed to the Infrastructure team, we are evaluating a bot that converts Slack messages in [#infrastructure_lounge](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CB3LSMEJV) channel into GitLab issues.

#### Workflow Overview

- **Acknowledgement**: An agent responds with the `acknowledged_emoji` (👀 in our case) to acknowledge a Slack message in the Infrastructure Lounge channel.
- **Issue Creation**: The Slack bot then creates an issue with the acknowledging agent assigned to it.
- **Thread Attachment**: The Slack thread corresponding to the message is also posted on the created GitLab issue.
- **Label Assignment**: Agents can further categorize issues by adding label emojis (`ops`, `foundations`, `scalability-observability` or `scalability-practices`) in the Slack message. This action automatically assigns the issue to the respective team: Ops, Foundations, Scalability-Observability or Scalability-Practices.
- **Project Tracking**: These converted issues are tracked under a dedicated project hosted at [Infrastructure Lounge Slack Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure-lounge-slack-issue-tracker).
- **Issue Closure**: Agents/Requester can close the issue when resolved by adding any of the `resolved_emojis` (`green-circle-check`,`white_check_mark`or `checked`in our case)

#### Configuration

Agents responsible for handling these issues are defined in a JSON file, which serves as a [CI/CD variable](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure-lounge-slack-issue-creator/-/settings/ci_cd). Currently, this file contains a static list of all members of the infrastructure department.

### Project and Backlog Management

We use epics and issues to manage our work. [Our project management process](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/project-management/) is shared between all teams in SaaS Plaforms.

### Tools

The Platforms section builds and maintains various tools to help deploy, operate and monitor our SaaS platforms. You can view a list of these tools in the [Platforms Tools Index](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/tools/).

### OKR

We use objective and key results to set goals in alignment with [OKRs at GitLab](/handbook/company/okrs/).
[Our OKR process](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/okrs/) is shared between all teams in Saas Platforms.

### Hiring

[Our hiring process](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/platforms/hiring/) is shared between all teams in SaaS Plaforms.
