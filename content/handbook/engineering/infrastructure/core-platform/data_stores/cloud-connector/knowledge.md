title: Application Performance Group - Knowledge Sharing
---

## Knowledge Sharing

Early in the days of the Application Performance group's formation we started an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/memory-team/team-tasks/-/issues/13) to share memory domain articles, books and resources within our group and GitLab.  We are moving some of these resources to a shared handbook page.  We aim to update this frequently.

### Our approach to performance problems

We are life-long learners and every new challenge we take on means lessons were learned, and we
think that other teams can benefit from us documenting these.

We have therefore started to document [how we approach performance and memory related issues](approach.html), as well
as some common themes we have observed over the past months.

### Internal Training Materials

We have a materials shared in our internal `Ruby on Rails Performance Training` Google Drive.  To view the materials ensure that you are logged in with your GitLab account and go to [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/) and expand your Shared Drives.  Everyone within GitLab should have access to these materials, but if you do not please submit an [access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request).
