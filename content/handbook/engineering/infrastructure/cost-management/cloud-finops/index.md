## Cloud FinOps at GitLab

### Overview of the data pipeline

The GCP billing Profit & Loss (P&L) allocation pipeline takes raw GCP billing data and allocates costs to P&L categories for analysis and reporting. It provides a daily overview of GCP costs by P&L category (free. internal, paid).

The pipeline consists of the following key steps:

1. Map raw GCP billing data to infrastructure labels (rpt_gcp_billing_infra_mapping_day)
2. Calculate usage and costs for various infrastructure components like CI runners, storage, etc. and map to P&L categories (models ending in _pl_daily)
3. Combine all P&L mappings into a unified mapping table (combined_pl_mapping)
4. Apply the combined P&L mappings to the raw GCP data (rpt_gcp_billing_pl_day_combined)
5. Apply the lookback mappings to the raw GCP data (rpt_gcp_billing_pl_day)
6. Output final allocated costs by P&L category and applies a hierarchy for exploration on Tableau (rpt_gcp_billing_pl_day_ext)

The workflow follows a data transformation pipeline pattern:

- Raw input → Enrichment models → Unified mappings → Allocation → P&L output

### Lineage

### Combined mappings

The combined P&L mappings consolidate all the individual mapping logic into a single model for simplicity.

### Lookback mappings

The lookback mappings are used to retroactively apply updated profit and loss (P&L) allocations to historical data. This ensures consistency in P&L reporting over time.
In Google's Cloud Billing data, our commitment costs are still incurred on the projects using the eligible compute resources. Once we apply the P&L split to a certain area of costs, the CUD lines are not mapped and must be mapped by looking back on the same perimeters.

There are two lookback mapping models:

- flex_cud_lookback: applies the P&L split retroactively to the Flex CUD SKUs in the same perimeter
- t2d_cud_lookback: applies the P&L split retroactively to the T2D CUD SKUs in the same perimeter

- **CI Runners**: Continuous Integration runners are virtual machines or containers that execute the code in a CI/CD process.
- **BigQuery**: A fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. It is a part of the Google Cloud Platform.
- **HAproxy**: High Availability proxy is software that provides high availability, load balancing, and proxying for applications.
- **Tableau**: A visual analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problems.
- **Grafana**: An open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics.
- **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: A specific type of item for sale, such as a product or service, and all attributes associated with the item type that distinguish it from other item types.
