## Introduction

This page helps guide Support Engineers (SEs) to [find](#zendesk-views),
[select](#selecting-new-tickets), and [work](#first-response-and-ongoing-communication)
support tickets.

## Zendesk views

The default views in Zendesk for Support Engineers (SEs).

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [My Assigned Tickets](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/filters/360062369834) | Tickets assigned to you that are not `Solved` or `Closed`. |
| The Global Support Ticket View| Shows all unassigned tickets, sorted by ticket weight. This is the primary view for all support engineers to work from. |
| Assigned Support Engineer Tickets | Tickets from organizations that have an Assigned Support Engineer (ASE). |
| L&R | Licensing & Renewals tickets |
| All FRT and Emergencies | `New` tickets in the FRT stage.|
| All NRT | Non-new tickets in the NRT stage.|

## Selecting new tickets

Employ the following workflows for:

 Choosing Tickets:

- Work from the top of `The Global Support Ticket View`. Tickets are sorted by `Ticket Weight` to prioritize the highest-impact tickets first. Tickets receive additional weight as they progress through their FRT and NRT life-cycles, ensuring that soon to breach tickets do not remain low in the view.  When everyone aims to start from the top of the of the queue, it supports our ability to achieve our SLAs.
- Tickets with a preferred region that aligns to your region you can take and keep assignment of.  For other regions,  work them by putting out a quality first response, then follow the guidelines for [rehoming tickets](#ticket-rehome-transfer-to-the-preferred-region) to transfer them to the customers stated preferred region. (NOTE: APAC may also maintain assignment of low priority tickets with a preferred region of AMER.)
- Both FRT and NRT tickets that do not have an assignee are presented in this view. Consider assigning tickets with a status of `open` or `pending` and a preferred region that aligns to your region. These all need owners within the preferred region on the same day they are rehomed from other regions. Refer to the [receiving a ticket rehome](#receiving-a-ticket-rehome) section of this page for guidelines on working these tickets.

 Assigning Tickets:

- Assign tickets to yourself using the "Take It" button and update status to
     `Open` or `Pending`.
- Please Note that the SLA clock continues to run until you've sent a public
      response to the user.

## Managing ticket load

- Regularly review your `open`, `pending`, and `on-hold` tickets under
      [My Assigned Tickets](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/filters/360062369834)
      to maintain a balanced workload.
- Aim for a manageable number of tickets, adjusting based on daily demands
     and personal capacity.
- Aim to adhere to the support ticket SLA/SLOs:
  - Urgent FRT 30m, NRT 4h
  - High FRT 4h, NRT 4h
  - Normal FRT 8h, NRT 24h
  - Low FRT 24h, NRT 24h

## First response and ongoing communication

When starting work on a ticket, prioritize these steps to effectively address
the customer's needs and streamline the resolution process:

1. **Confirm Understanding:** Begin by confirming in the first response your
   understanding of the customer's situation, needs, and the problem or question
   they need resolved. If unsure, request clarification or propose a brief
   meeting to discuss details.
2. **Review Past Interactions:** Check the customer's recent tickets for related
   issues or useful background information. Confirm any relevant environmental
   details with the customer and review any organizational notes in Zendesk that
   might dictate specific actions or communication methods.
3. **Adjust Priorities:** If the ticket's priority doesn't align with our
   [Definitions of Support Impact](https://about.gitlab.com/support/definitions/#definitions-of-support-impact),
   discuss and adjust the priority with the customer using the
   `General::Changed priority` macro.
4. **Prepare for Emergencies:** If the ticket could escalate to an emergency,
   alert the on-call engineer(s).
5. **Manage Time Effectively:** If an extensive response is required or the SLA
   is near breaching, send an initial brief response. Outline the actions you
   will take and when the customer can expect an update. Adjust timelines as
   necessary based on customer feedback.
6. **Use Tools:** Set the ticket to Open and use 'Due Date' and 'Reminder' apps
   to keep track.

By following these steps, you ensure a structured approach to ticket handling
that can save time and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Ticket transfers

GitLab Support defines two different types of ticket transfers:

### Rehome definition

A `rehome` is a transfer of a ticket from the region of the SE who delivered
the first response to the customer's specified preferred region

### Handover definition

A `handover` is a transfer of a ticket to a different SE in **any** region
for any reason other than regional preference, such as the assignee taking time
off.

## Ticket rehome (transfer to the preferred region)

GitLab Support uses a single view for all unassigned
tickets, regardless of region. The tickets in the view are sorted by
`Ticket Weight` to highlight the highest-priority issues first, and support
engineers are expected to work from the top of the view down. Given this
process, support engineers will frequently be taking tickets on which the
customer has specified a `Preferred region` different from their own.

Since we aim in GitLab Support to align tickets to an accountable region, we use
the following simple process to handle tickets from different regions:

### First response

When providing the first response to a ticket from a different region, follow
these guidelines:

1. Introduce yourself and acknowledge the customer's preferred region. (`Support::Out of Region::Cross-region_Preferred region clarify assignment` macro is a good starting point)
1. Explain that you're providing initial assistance to ensure a timely response.
1. Proceed with all appropriate initial steps to begin addressing the customer's
   issue.
1. Inform the customer that before the end of your workday you will transfer
   their ticket to their preferred region for continued support **unless they
   request that you keep it**.
1. If it's the end of your work day and the customer hasn't confirmed the region, move it to the region that they chose when they created the ticket. To do that run the `Support::Rehome::Initiate Rehome` macro.

### Initiating a ticket rehome

To initiate a ticket rehome, simply use the `Support::Rehome::Initiate Rehome`
macro. This macro will:

1. Remove ticket assignment
1. Apply the `rehome_initiated` tag

If the ticket is waiting on a customer reply put the ticket into "Pending", if the ticket is waiting on a reply from a support engineer put the ticket into "Open".

### Receiving a ticket rehome

When you take an unassigned ticket from the global view and you see an internal
comment that states `Rehome initiated from [assignee's region] to [target
region]`, you should follow these steps to receive that rehome:

1. **Verify Regional Alignment:** If the target region specified is your region,
   continue. Otherwise, leave the ticket unassigned in the view so that an SE
   from the target region can take it.
1. Use the `Support::Rehome::Complete Rehome` macro, which:
   1. Assigns the ticket to you
   1. Applies the `rehome_received` tag
   1. Creates a public response with some initial text for your use
1. Edit the initial text to use your name where the placeholder is
1. Proceed with all appropriate initial steps to begin addressing the customer's
   issue, and replace the `Next Steps Here` placeholder with your full update to
   the customer

### Keeping an out-of-region ticket

If a customer responds to your initial update on the ticket with an explicit
request that you keep the ticket rather than transferring it to their preferred
region, you should follow these steps:

1. Use the `Support::Rehome::Do Not Rehome` macro, which creates a public
   comment with some initial text for you to use.
1. Proceed as you would with any other ticket

## Ticket handover (assignee change not related to preferred region)

**This section needs to be updated to describe the handover process in the light
  of the 2024-08-01 [definition](#handover-definition) of handover.**

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">Preparing a ticket for handover</summary>

1. Set the proper expectations to the customer.
   1. It is important to be transparent and communicate that certain requirements, such as phone calls and immediate responses, will necessitate coordination with the receiving region.
   1. Please ensure that the receiving team is properly informed and aligned on any tasks and timelines before finalizing them with the customer.
1. Use the Zendesk [Zendesk `Handover Ticket Summary` macro](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/zendesk-global/macros/-/blob/master/active/Support/Out%20of%20Region/Handover%20Ticket%20Summary.md)
   to ensure all necessary information is included and the ticket is unassigned.
1. Set the Zendesk Form Field `Handover Status` to `Need Handover`.
1. CC yourself on the ticket and save the ticket to the `Open State`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown="span">Working tickets handed over from another region</summary>

1. Update the `Handover Status` text field to reflect the receiving region. For
   example, if you are in the EMEA region, set it to `Handed over to EMEA` to
   ensure accurate metric tracking.
1. Review the `Handover Ticket Summary` and the Next Response Time (NRT) SLA.
1. If ready to proceed:
   - Introduce yourself to the customer, confirm the handover, and provide the
     next technical response.
1. If additional research is needed:
   - Introduce yourself, inform the customer that further research is required,
     and set expectations for the next steps.

## Contacting a Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Account Manager (AM)

Engage a CSM or AM for reasons such as discussing architecture, Professional
Services, or support collaboration. If escalation is required, follow the
designated workflow. If no CSM is available, contact the AM, identified in
Zendesk as `Account Owner`. To involve a CSM or AM, use the following methods:

1. Zendesk: Add the CSM/AM as a CC on the ticket, inform the customer, and add
   an internal note for context.
2. Slack: Notify the CSM/AM with one of the following:
   - Mention them in an existing ticket discussion.
   - Start a new thread in the customer's channel
     (#a_customerName-internal).
   - Post a message in a relevant support channel (`#support_leadership`,
     `#support_gitlab-com`, or `#support-self_managed`).

### Helping with a ticket that has an Assigned Support Engineer

Some customers have an Assigned Support Engineer (ASE) that will own their
tickets. This will be apparent from the org note in the ticket. For such
customers, see [the ASE workflow](assigned-support-engineer/working-on-ase-tickets.html).

## FAQ

### How many new tickets should I pick up each week?

Each week, every Support Engineer should aim at least to meet, and preferably to
exceed, [the appropriate baseline](/handbook/support/support-engineer-responsibilities/#ticket-baseline)
from the following list for the number of first responses:

| Ticket type   | FRT goal   |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Self-managed  | 6 tickets  |
| SaaS          | 7 tickets  |
| SaaS Accounts | 8 tickets  |
| L&R           | 24 tickets |

The aim is to ensure equitable ticket distribution among team members. These
numbers are based on ticket volume, number of SEs, and average PTO (15%). We
continuously monitor ticket volume and number of SEs to make sure the above
guidelines are accurate.

#### What if I can't meet baseline?

There will be times when you may be leading an escalation, working through
challenging tickets, or focusing on non-ticket work, and you cannot take on new
ticket assignment. This is okay! The key is to make sure you have coordinated
with your regional team and Manager so they are aware of the risks to our team.

### What can I do when I'm stuck and I really need help?

Follow the [how to get help](/handbook/support/workflows/how-to-get-help/)
workflow for guidance.

### I'm going to be absent, what do I do with my assigned tickets?

Please see the [Support Team Member Time Off](/handbook/support/support-time-off/)
page for guidance on taking time off.

### What if the customer is absent and wants to keep the ticket open until they return?

In this scenario:

1. Acknowledge the customer's request and inform them of your plan.
1. Set the ticket status to `on-hold`.
1. Change the ticket type to **Task**.
1. Set a reminder for yourself to check in with the customer 1-2 days after
   their planned return date.

Because of the [behavior of `On-Hold` tickets](/handbook/support/workflows/zendesk-ticket-basics/#behavior-of-on-hold-tickets)
the ticket will remain in the `on-hold` state until the customer returns. This
is useful if the customer will be unavailable for 1-2 weeks. If a customer will
be unavailable for a longer period of time, consider asking them to handover the
ticket to a colleague, or open a new ticket upon their return.

### May I reassign a ticket to someone else?

There are some situations in which it is appropriate to reassign a ticket. A few
common situations are listed below, but others may arise. If you encounter a
scenario where you need to reassign a ticket that isn't detailed in the
handbook, please discuss with your manager, and then add it below!

#### If you'll be out of office

If you're out of office, either planned or unplanned, follow the guidance in
[Support Team Member Time Off](/handbook/support/support-time-off/).

#### If you need an expert

If you've determined that specific expertise outside your own is required to
resolve the ticket, pair with an expert so that you can get the ticket resolved
and learn in the process. If that person determines that they need to take the
lead due to the advanced or complex nature of the problem, then:

1. Send a message to the customer informing them:
   - You've asked another support engineer with relevant expertise to take the
     ticket
   - You've reviewed the ticket with that engineer
   - You'll stay involved in order to help in any way you can
1. Assign the ticket to the expert

#### If you have too many tickets

If you've become overloaded with tickets, you may look to find one or more other
SEs to take some of your tickets. Be sure you discuss each ticket before
reassigning it to gain agreement and so that the other support engineers don't
have to start from scratch.

Once you've found a new assignee:

1. Add an internal note summarizing the ticket and noting the reassignment
1. Send a public reply to the customer informing them of the reassignment
1. Reassign to the new engineer

### What if a customer has confirmed a ticket can be closed but the ticket has no assignee?

While we should ensure that all tickets always have an assignee from FRT to,
close, there are some scenarios where a ticket is ready to be closed but has no
assignee. For example, a customer may open a ticket and inform us that they have
resolved the issue before we send an FRT. In these scenarios:

1. Inform the customer that you are changing the ticket status to solved
1. Assign the ticket
   - If a solution was provided, assign to the engineer who provided the
     solution
   - If the issue was not solved as the result of a direct suggestion, assign it
     to an engineer who has significantly contributed to the ticket throughout
     its life cycle
   - If the customer solved the ticket before we could respond, take assignment
     of the ticket yourself. After all, you're doing the work of acknowledging
     the customer's update, and solving the ticket!
1. Mark the ticket as `solved`

### How many issues or incidents should I handle in a single support ticket?

As detailed in [Support General Policies](https://about.gitlab.com/support/general-policies/#we-handle-each-incident-within-a-single-support-ticket)
it is GitLab's policy to handle each unique issue or incident within a single
support ticket.

### How can I open a new ticket on behalf of a customer?

As detailed in the [Support General Policies](https://about.gitlab.com/support/general-policies/#we-handle-each-incident-within-a-single-support-ticket)
it is GitLab policy to handle each individual incident, problem or issue within
a single support ticket. If a situation arises where you need to open a new
ticket on behalf of a customer, you **must** use the [Create new ticket plugin](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/zendesk/apps/global-apps/#:~:text=current%20plugins%20are%3A-,Create%20new%20ticket,-Allows%20an%20agent)
within the [Zendesk Super App](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/zendesk/apps/global-apps/#zendesk-super-app)
to ensure proper routing and SLA assignment:

1. Within a ticket, navigate to the Zendesk Super App and select the Create new
   ticket plugin.
1. Select the appropriate form type. This will most likely match the request
   type of the originating ticket.
1. Enter the customer's details like subject, problem description and other 
   relevant information. Use the customer's existing Zendesk Ticket to obtain
   the necessary customer information to complete the form.
1. Submit the ticket using the `Create Ticket` button.

Once the new ticket has been submitted, the app will provide you with the
corresponding ticket ID. You can click the ticket ID to directly navigate
to the newly created ticket.

If you plan to immediately start working the ticket, please assign the ticket to
yourself.
