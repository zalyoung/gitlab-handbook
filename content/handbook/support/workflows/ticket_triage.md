## Purpose of this page

This page aims to walk you through some basic checks and items to tick off when triaging tickets in ZenDesk.

## Overview

In previous years, triage of tickets was done in the `Needs Org` queue and required Support Engineers to ensure that tickets were assigned to their organizations with proof of entitlement. Currently, all submitted tickets should have an organization or belong to a free user. Tickets from users who are not listed contacts will automatically be rejected and closed with [instructions on how to become a contact for their organization](https://about.gitlab.com/support/managing-support-contacts/). However, customers may still submit tickets under the wrong forms, so having accurate information helps with reporting and getting the tickets to the right people.

## Overall Flow

```

## Applying the Correct Form

A ticket should have the correct [form](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/zendesk/forms/) applied to it to help route it to the right set of individuals who can assist with that request.

The single source of truth for what forms exist is the [Current active forms](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/zendesk/forms/) list in the Support Ops handbook section.

Below is a list of some commonly used Zendesk forms with a brief explanation regarding their usage:

- Self-Managed: An issue where the customer is maintaining their own local instance of GitLab
- SaaS (GitLab.com): An issue involving the GitLab hosted SaaS offering
- SaaS Account: Single user account issue only, all others go to GitLab.com (SaaS).
- L&R (License and Renewals): subscription and purchase issues, see also [L&R workflows](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/).
- Level Up: For tickets that should go to the Professional Services team, such as requests about [the GitLab LevelUp platform](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/level-up/)(`levelup.gitlab.com`).

**Please note:** Please follow the guidance under [Moving to non-support forms](#moving-to-non-support-forms) to *change* the ticket form, unless it's between Self-Managed, SaaS (GitLab.com) and SaaS Account.

### For security related matters

Apply the macro `Security::All Security Questions`. This will reply and mark the ticket `solved`.

### Moving to non-support forms

For cases that need to go to non-support forms, apply the `General::Forms::Incorrect form used` macro. Support Operations will do the rest from there.

### Handling Free User tickets

Free Users who are reporting Self-Managed or SaaS issues

1. Triage the Free User ticket and verify if they are a SaaS user who meets the support criteria outlined in the [free users section of the statement of support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#free-users).
1. If they do not meet the above criteria or the ticket is for a self-managed Free User, in `New` tickets you can select `Free customer` in `Self-Managed Subscription` dropdown, which will activate the [`Auto-close free and self-provisioned trial SM tickets`](https://gitlab.com/search?group_id=2573624&repository_ref=master&scope=blobs&search=id%3A+5475833679900&snippets=false) trigger (responds and solves the ticket). If the ticket is `Open`, then direct the customer to the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) via the ["Self-managed or GitLab.com Free User Request" macro](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=15990755&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&search=id%3A+360044960813) and mark it "Solved". If you wish to provide technical assistance to the user, then please do so via the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/).

Free Users who are reporting L&R issues

Triage the Free User ticket and verify if the user's issue relates to subscriptions or account/billing listed in the [Applying the Correct Form section](#applying-the-correct-form), change the form to the appropriate one so that a team member can deal with the request directly.

If the user is asking for assistance getting in contact with sales, you can use the "L&R" form.

If the request falls outside of such scenarios, see the [Other Requests section](#other-requests), or direct the user to the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) and the ticket marked as "Solved".

## After applying the correct form

- Apply the correct `Support - Category` and `Subcategory` if possible.
- If missing, gather information about the `GitLab Install Type`, `Reference Architecture` and `GitLab Version`
- Consider gathering any other information that might be missing if the customer used the incorrect form.

## US Government tickets in Global Support Portal

Users of GitLab's [US Government Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/us-government-support/) offering may opt to raise a ticket in the Global Support Portal as well. The most common reason for this is the need for support outside of the US Government's [hours of operation](https://about.gitlab.com/support/us-government-support/#hours-of-operation). If during the triage process, a Global Agent comes across a ticket that is from an organization which appears to be a customer entitled to US Government Support, the agent can work this case the same as they would any other ticket.

If a ticket is created through the Global Support Portal and a request is made that only agents with US citizenship handle the case, then the agent should direct the customer to file a new case via the US Government Support portal and make their account team aware.
