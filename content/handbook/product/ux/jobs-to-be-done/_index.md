title: Jobs to be Done at GitLab
description: JTBD is a practical framework for understanding customers' desired outcomes.
---

Customers purchase products and services to get a Job done. This principle is at the core of Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Theory. JTBD is a practical framework for understanding customers' desired outcomes. It shifts the focus from the solution to the problem the user is attempting to solve and the outcome they aim to achieve. This clarity enables you to ask the right question: **What outcome are you trying to influence**?

_The Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) Theory provides a framework for categorizing, defining, capturing, and organizing all your customers' needs and tying customer-defined performance metrics (in the form of desired outcome statements) to the job-to-be-done. - Anthony Ulwick, Jobs-to-be-done, Theory to Practice, 2023._

## Framework Overview

1. **[Define the Job:](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd-playbook)** The first step of the JTBD framework is to understand who your [Job Performers](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) are and the [Jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-types) they are responsible for in your [Domain](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#domain). This step lays the groundwork for the rest of the framework upon which all activities rely.
2. **[Uncover Needs:](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd-playbook)** After defining the [Jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-types) in your [Domain](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#domain), the next step is to draft [Outcomes statements](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcome-statements). These will be used to benchmark the experience, evaluate solutions, and prioritize future efforts.
3. **[Quantify Outcomes:](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd-playbook/#Exercise-2:-Synthesize-Outcomes)** The next step in the process is to understand how well your customers' needs are met with the current experience. This is akin to benchmarking and will result in a quantitative analysis of all your [Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes) and the degree to which they are being met.
4. **Evaluate Solutions:** Once you establish a benchmark for your [Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes), you will continually refer to them as you create and validate solutions, checking to see if you have made a significant impact.

## Core Concepts

### Job Performers vs. Personas

Understanding the roles and contributions of [Job Performers](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) (someone executing a Job) and Personas is crucial and highly valuable in the JTBD framework. Each Persona, like a Software Developer, may undertake various [Jobs](handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#job-types) as part of their role (writing code, reviewing code, maintaining infrastructure, and so on). Similarly, other job titles or Personas may also undertake the [Main Job](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#main-jobs) in JTBD; for example, an engineering manager may review code or plan projects. Both Personas and [Job Performers](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) are valuable constructs that help understand and improve your product, but it is essential to keep them separate.

### Job Types

Understanding the different [Job types](handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#job-types) and how they relate to each other is crucial for mapping out the entire customer experience and identifying opportunities to create value. There are several key [Job types](handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#job-types) to consider in the JTBD framework:

- **Main Jobs:** The overarching goal or objective that the [Job Performer](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) is trying to achieve is the [Main Job](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Main-Jobs). This is the highest-level job for a given [Domain](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#domain). [Main Jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Main-Jobs) are mapped using a Job Map and are always solution-agnostic.
- **Consumption Jobs:** The specific tasks a [Job Performer](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) undertakes when interacting with a product or service are the [Consumption Jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Consumption-Jobs). These include every step from identifying a need, finding and selecting a solution, purchasing, configuring, using, maintaining, and eventually discontinuing its use. [Consumption Jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Consumption-Jobs) do not have a Job Map and are often solution-dependent.
- **Related Jobs:** Other jobs that the [Job Performer](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) may be trying to get done, either before, during, or after the [Main Jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Main-Jobs) (this may include Consumption Jobs). Understanding the Related Jobs is **vital to providing the best platform experience** for the customer.

### Job Maps

The Job Map is a visual representation of the sequence of [Stages](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Stages) a [Job Performer](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Performers) goes through to complete the [Main Job](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Main-Jobs). It reveals the underlying patterns of intent and the subgoals that comprise the overall Job.

![Job Map](Concepts_Job_Map.png)

Common [Stages](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Stages) of a Job Map include, _but are not limited to:_

- Define: Determine objectives and plan how to get the job done
- Locate: Gather materials and information needed to do the job
- Prepare: Organize materials and create the right setup
- Confirm: Ensure that everything is ready to perform the job
- Execute: Perform the job as planned
- Monitor: Evaluate success as the job is executed
- Modify: Modify and iterate as necessary
- Conclude: End the job and follow-up

These [Stages](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Stages) are arranged in a logical flow, with related [Job Steps](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Steps) clustered together with their relevant [Job Stage](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Job-Stages). When complete and validated with users, the Job Map will serve as a foundation for creating [Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes) and uncovering [Underserved Needs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Underserved-Needs).

### Outcomes

[Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes) are the specific, measurable, and actionable results that customers want to achieve when getting a Job done. They represent the desired end-state or performance metrics that customers use to evaluate the success of a solution.

**[Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes) are the most crucial part of the JTBD framework**, as they help you understand what customers truly value and how to design solutions that better meet their needs. By focusing on Outcomes rather than features or functionality, you can uncover unmet or [Underserved Needs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Underserved-Needs) and identify opportunities to create differentiated value. By understanding the [Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes) that customers care about, you can design more effective solutions, make better prioritization decisions, and measure the true impact of your work.

![Job Map](Concepts_Outcomes.png)

### Continuous Evaluation

Using [Outcomes](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd_topics__definitions/#Outcomes) to prioritize, design, and measure, allows for predictable, repeatable, and consistent evaluation methods, creating feedback loops that relate directly to the outcomes you are trying to influence.

- **Benchmarking:** Evaluate the Main Job and Consumption Job Outcomes to establish a benchmark and assist with prioritization by identifying underserved needs.
- **Solution Evaluation** Evaluate how your solution improves the targeted Outcome(s), using the established benchmark as reference.

### JTBD Hierarchy

Using our examples, we can produce a JTBD hierarchy, confirming we operate at the right altitude.

- **Main Job**: Maintain an acceptable level of risk in my organizations assets.
- **Small job**: Prioritize business-critical vulnerabilities in my assets.
- **Micro jobs**: Review the most recent risks detected in my assets; Refine the list of risks by relevancy; Refine the list of risks by impact.

### Using JTBD at GitLab

There are many methods a stage group may use to find or define strategic opportunities with JTBD. You can see more detailed uses of JTBD on our [How to use Jobs to Be Done](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/using-jtbd/) handbook page. If you plan on using one of these methods, remember to use [interviews to validate your jobs](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/deep-dive/#how-do-i-discover-jtbd-relevant-to-my-group) before spending too much time learning about inaccurate jobs.

## Quick methods to increase confidence

- Reference previous research and industry standards.
- Conduct [generative problem validation research](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/problem-validation-and-methods/#when-to-use-problem-validation) using broad questions. For example, ask questions like, "tell me what you do as a software engineer."
- Run abbreviated 30-minute job interviews with a minimum of 5 participants (direct questions). For example, ask questions based on the JTBD such as, "tell me about the last time you made an architectural decision. What went well? What didn't go so well?" Document your interview using the [JTBD Interview Note template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSX5b57MKfLFl59TfiN61rWNkm2Qctb8cVy40JUGsF6FyEcy3jhPBUxY-4D3exXxqXPwwBkcSOb0HT8/pub?output=xlsx).

## Job stories and user stories

Read "[What is and isn't a JTBD](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/deep-dive/#what-is-a-jtbd)".

[Job stories differ from user stories](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27) because they are persona, product, and solution agnostic. This allows us to think more deeply about the user's context, motivations, and needs rather than just a *title, task, and goal*.

*Example:*

- **Job**: Address business-critical risks in my organization's assets.
- **Job story**: When I am on triage rotation, I want to address business-critical risks in my organization's assets, so I can minimize the likelihood of a security incident.
- **User story**: As a Security Analyst, I want to address vulnerabilities in my applications, So that I can ensure there are no unattended risks.

Job stories offer a higher-level view of the main objective. However, when written at a lower altitude, they can serve the same function as user stories, guiding your solutions while keeping the Main Job, circumstances, and need in mind.

title: "Mapping Jobs to be Done (JTBD)"
description: "How do I create a job map? How do I validate a JTBD?"
---

The Main Job is a process that you can sequence chronologically into a Job Map. A Job Map reveals the process of completing the job from the executor's point of view, not the buyer or customer perspective. The intent is to illustrate what the Job Performer is striving to get done at each stage in executing a job.

## What a Job Map is not

A Job Map is not a customer journey, service blueprint, or workflow diagram. It does not reflect what a person does to discover, learn about, select, buy, and use a product or service. These activities are relevant to the buyer and purchasing process.

It's also not about mapping tasks or physical activities, but about creating a sequence of smaller goals that make up the Main Job. Ideally, the Job Map will not include any means of performing the job.

## How to create a Job Map

From your interviews, create a sequence of stages in a visual representation that shows underlying patterns of intent. As you map, think about what the Job Performer's subgoals are and the phases of intent that unfold as the job gets done. There is a [template in FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/M8w3pkidNUAUIQrQALifFS/JTBD-Template?type=whiteboard&t=HXmKttyxz1lwX9B8-6) that you can use for this. The template uses the eight standard phases from Tony Ulwick's [Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) method](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/outcome-driven-innovation-odi-is-jobs-to-be-done-theory-in-practice-2944c6ebc40e).

Each stage should have a purpose and be formulated as a functional job. Avoid including emotional and social aspects in the stage labels, and avoid bringing in adjectives and qualifiers that indicate a need, like "quickly" or "accurately." Strive to make the stages as universal and stable as possible without reference to the means of execution. Jobs are separate from solutions.

Consider these job stages as more of a guideline than a prescriptive model. The point is to remember to cover all types of stages involved in executing the Main Job&mdash;before, during, and after. Modify the names of the stages as needed to describe your particular Main Job, but keep them short (ideally expressed as single-word verbs). The table below reflects some common verbs for each of the stage types in the universal job map.

| Stage      | Description                                            | Common Verbs                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Define     | Determine objectives and plan how to get the job done. | Define, Plan, Select, Determine        |
| Locate     | Gather materials and information needed to do the job. | Locate, Gather, Access, Retrieve       |
| Prepare    | Organize materials and create the right setup.         | Prepare, Set up, Organize, Examine     |
| Confirm    | Ensure that everything is ready to perform the job.    | Confirm, Validate, Prioritize, Decide  |
| Execute    | Perform the job as planned.                            | Execute, Perform, Transact, Administer |
| Monitor    | Evaluate success as the job is executed.               | Monitor, Verify, Track, Check          |
| Modify     | Modify and iterate as necessary.                       | Modify, Update, Adjust, Maintain       |
| Conclude   | End the job and follow-up.                             | Conclude, Store, Finish, Close         |

### Step 1 - Create a job map

1. Use this ([FigJam Template](https://www.figma.com/file/M8w3pkidNUAUIQrQALifFS/JTBD-Template?type=whiteboard&t=HXmKttyxz1lwX9B8-6)).
1. Start with the three large phases of the Main Job: beginning, middle, and end. Arrange the sub-jobs uncovered from your interviews in the appropriate category.
1. Continue to group the jobs into stages, using the universal stages as a starting point, but changing them as needed. Language is important, so spend time refining it as you go.

You might end up with fewer or more stages than eight. It's also possible to include a loop for interaction or even a branch in the flow. The diagram you create should stand as a clear model for describing the process of performing the job that everyone in your organization can relate to.

Ideally, you will validate this job map with Job Performers. Talk through it with them. If the labels and/or divisions between stages need a great deal of explanation or seem to be confusing, rework them until it's simple enough to be self-explanatory.

### Step 2 - Put the job map to use

You can use a Job Map to identify opportunities and ways to create new value. The Job Map ultimately defines the scope of your business/stage group. Align your solutions to it to spot gaps and opportunities. Compare alternative offerings and means of getting a job done for competitive insight. Prioritize areas within the job process to drive your service roadmap. Find opportunities that can be reflected in marketing campaigns and sales pitches.

To get started, ask yourself these questions:
- Is there a more efficient order of stages in performing the job?
- Where do people struggle the most to get the job done?
- What causes the job to get off track?
- Can you eliminate stages or steps along the way?
- How might the job be carried out in the future, given current trends?
- How might you get more of the job done for customers?
- What related jobs can your offering address or tie in to the job?

description: "There are more than a few frameworks for Jobs to be Done. The aim of this documentation is to adapt those frameworks to create a shared understanding that fits our needs."
---

There are more than a few different frameworks for Jobs to be Done (JTBD) out there. The aim of this documentation is to adapt those frameworks and create a shared understanding of a JTBD process that fits our needs here at GitLab.

Our goal is to make products that people want, as well as make people want our products. Using JTBD can help us do that.

## What is a JTBD?

- **A lens for viewing your products and solutions in terms of the jobs customers are trying to achieve.** Instead of looking at the demographic factors of usage, JTBD focuses on what people seek to achieve in a certain circumstance ([see Clayton Christensen's Milkshake video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGtw2C95Ms)).
- **A way to understand the goals that people want to accomplish.** Achieving those goals amounts to progress in their lives. Jobs are also the needs, motivators, and drivers of behavior: they predict why people behave the way they do. This moves beyond mere correlation and strives to find causality.
- **A chance to step back from your business and understand the objectives of the people you serve.** To innovate, don't ask customers about their preferences, but instead understand their underlying needs and motivations.
- **A framework for improving collaboration and communication across disciplines and stage groups.** Since JTBD isn't particular to any expertise (for example, product, UX, marketing), it can be used by all of these disciplines to focus team members on the core problem that the business aims to solve for its customers. For example, rather than marketing having personas, UX having user stories, and so on, the company can use JTBD to establish common, high-level definitions that everyone can use.

## What isn't a JTBD?

- **They are not about your product, service, or brand.** People "hire" products to get a job done. Instead of focusing on your own solution, you must first understand what people want and why that's important to them.
- **They are not about specific products or particular solutions.** Instead, they focus on the process that people go through to solve a problem.
- **They are not a replacement for the user persona framework.** The two contrasting viewpoints share similarities without being incompatible. They can be used together to gain a more holistic view of the product and its users. For example, you may want to consider the job statement and process while drafting the workflow of a new feature, but you may want to check specific content on a page suitable for a particular user persona.

## When should I use a JTBD?

Use JTBD throughout the design process, but most notably to:
- Define scope
- Validate direction
- Evaluate existing experiences
- Assess category maturity

## How do I structure a JTBD?

A core strength of JTBD is its structure, which clearly separates out various aspects of achieving objectives. The who, what, how, why, and when/where are analyzed individually, giving both precision and flexibility to JTBD methods.

### *Who* is the focus of a JTBD?

When writing a JTBD, focus on the **Job Performer**. In other words, write it from the perspective of an end user who is trying to do the job. Conversely, do not write a JTBD from the perspective of what GitLab (or the business stakeholder) wants to achieve.

Other functions within the job ecosystem to consider include the following:

- **Approver:** Someone who authorizes the acquisition of a solution
- **Reviewer:** Someone who examines a solution for appropriateness
- **Technician:** The person who integrates a solution and gets it working
- **Manager:** Someone who oversees a Job Performer while performing the job
- **Audience:** People who consume the output of performing the job
- **Assistant:** A person who aids and supports the Job Performer in getting the job done

Note that these different roles don't refer to job titles. Instead, they represent different functional actors within the context of getting a job done.

### *What* does the Job Performer want to accomplish (independent of your solution)?

The aim of the Job Performer is not to interact with your company but to get something done. Because they don't mention solutions or technology, jobs should be as timeless and unchanging as possible. Strive to frame jobs in a way that makes them stable, even as technology changes.

#### Is a Job Performer the same as a User Persona?

No, a user persona represents a person in an organization with a particular job title. That persona may have 3-4 Main Jobs, which can be expressed using the JTBD framework.  Similarly, the role of Job Performer can be taken by more than one user persona.

While using the JTBD framework, a user's job title or personal details are not as crucial as their capability to successfully carry out the job process. As a result, the two frameworks do have some overlap but are not designed to fit together perfectly. The following visual Venn diagram may be helpful in understanding this overlap.

![PerformerPersonaDiagram](persona-v-performer.png)

### *How* will the job get done? (objective of the JTBD)

The process follows Job Performers as they move through different goal stages in order to accomplish their goal.

- Understanding the process of the Job Performer's intent is key to JTBD.
- You can illustrate the job in a chronological map using a sequence of stages, such as Beginning, Middle, and End.
- Each stage can contain multiple user stories. Be careful not to get into the tasks/physical activities just yet.
- Because the job has to be "done," be sure to formulate the job in a way that has an end state.
- Once you have the sequence, specify the tasks needed to complete each user story.

### *Why* does the performer act in a certain way? What are their requirements or intended outcomes during the job process?

Why do the Job Performers act the way they do while getting a job done? Their actions might be tied to achieving specific outcomes, such as producing a specific report. Their actions might also be tied to requirements or processes to which they must adhere.

In JTBD, a need is seen in relation to getting the job done. Needs aren't demands from a solution, but an individual's requirements for getting a job done. Needs aren't aspirations, either, which are above the job in terms of abstraction.

Example: If a Main Job is defined as *file taxes*, their need may be to *minimize the time it takes to gather documents or maximize the likelihood of getting a return*.

Example: Expressions like "have financial peace of mind" or "provide for my family" are motivations beyond getting the job. These are important aspects to consider later, but not needs related to reaching the objective of filing taxes.

### *When and where* does the job get done?

The circumstance (or contextual factors) that frame job execution include when and where the job gets done; for example, aspects around time, manner, and place. A job without context is not complete and cannot provide strategic direction. There is a dependency between formulating a job and knowing the circumstances.

JTBD uses circumstances to make them relevant to an organization. The conditions around the job give it meaning and relevance and therefore must be considered. Adding contextual detail to the situation also helps greatly when designing a solution.

Example: *Get breakfast* is a very broad job that could apply to many situations. But for a fast food restaurant, *get breakfast on the go*, is a more precise job to focus on.

Example: A solution for the job *get breakfast on the go* could include everything from going to a restaurant or diner to eating a packed lunch at a desk. But when considering specific circumstances like *when late for work, while commuting* and *when cost is a factor*, a morning milkshake might be a better solution for the job.

### *How do I discover* JTBD relevant to my group?

Jobs to be Done are discovered by interviewing real-world users. At GitLab, it is advised to use the assistance of a UX Researcher throughout the process.

1. Determine the project's scope with the relevant stakeholders. Understanding who you want to talk to you and what jobs you want to understand is just as important as determining what jobs are not in scope for this project.
1. Create a problem validation issue similar to this [example issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2223) in the UX Research project, and fill out the description.
1. You may create an assumptive JTBD map with internal stakeholders [similar to this template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/154noxIz5_ziAk9KHASHqb8faYCTw9ZyQ/view?usp=sharing). You can also validate your findings through desk research. This map can prepare you for the participant's workflow and the language they might use to describe their job. This is activity is optional.
1. When you're ready to interview external participants, adjust this [screener template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1paH7wpXvCIOIDIy_GiDkbXWy3gfF4a8WXGYzLDMONkc/copy) as needed. Remember to recruit GitLab users and non-users, as the JTBD framework is product-agnostic.
1. Afterwards, you can modify this [JTBD Script template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnvsJtWrLntliOxyYudrSnqatmxPZBvAYobXusW2np8/copy) to help you conduct the interviews. Remember to keep the scope and output of the interviews in mind while modifying the script. Keep in mind the job process and statement should be something that does not need a user interface and might even be applicable in the distant future.
1. Finally, summarize the data using a Figjam board similar to this [previously used JTBD canvas](https://www.figma.com/file/chlrPbqJWNELUR2dFapUcL/JTBD-%26-JTBD-Research-%3E-Secure-and-Govern-Job-Canvas-and-Heirarchy_2023-08-23_11-14-17?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=VaQ5WIqs1zyElt3e-0). If possible, have a note-taker fill out each participant's canvas as the interviews take place. Then, present it to the participant as a way to verify the information.

### *How can I use* JTBD?

JTBD can be used to obtain valuable insights through numerous methods, from screeners to heuristic evaluations. You can see more detailed uses of JTBD on our [How to use Jobs to Be Done](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/using-jtbd/) handbook page. If you plan on using one of these methods, remember to use interviews to validate your jobs before spending too much time learning about inaccurate jobs.

## JTBD examples and tips

JTBDs are difficult to get right can take some time to refine. Below is an example of a job statement and its versions throughout the refinement process. The feedback provided for each version can offer some helpful tips to keep in mind when you're writing them.

Version 1: When new features are added to a product, I want to know if and how those changes impact performance so that I can ensure my product works as expected for users.

- "When new features are added to a product" - Make sure to describe the circumstances the Job Performer is in when they need to get the job done. New features being added is not an isolated act.
- "I want to know if and how those changes impact performance" - This job can be a bit more specific (instead of using "if and how"). It will be easier to validate when you focus on one aspect of the need/outcome for the Job Performer.
- "so that I can ensure my product works as expected for users" -  How can you make the outcome for the Job Performer more specific? Why is it important that the product works as expected? What is the desired end state and/or feeling that a Job Performer has for doing this job? Make sure to describe the circumstances that the Job Performer is in when they need to get the job done.

Version 2: When I or my teammate is making a code change to our product, I want to know if the change introduces a latency for my end users so that I can ensure users are satisfied with the performance of the product and continue to use it

- "When I or my teammate is making a code change to our product" - We don't need to specify the "who" this is for since it seems to apply to any code changes to the product.
- "so that I can ensure users are satisfied with the performance of the product and continue to use it" - Handling a latency doesn't measure satisfaction, but it deals directly with usability.
