title: "User Satisfaction (USAT) Survey"
description: "The User Satisfaction (USAT) survey is a performance indicator we use within the Product division to measure the end user satisfaction of our product."
---

* Within the Product division, we have adopted [Product Customer Satisfaction Score (PCSAT)](https://www.qualtrics.com/en-gb/experience-management/customer/what-is-csat/) and are conducting this survey on a quarterly basis.
  * We previously surveyed users with the Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric, which we moved away from starting in FY25 Q1 ([see internal only proposal deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18FYO0UoUQi__7hPnD0uhVmeJrN16n23OISQnom0eRE8/edit?usp=sharing)).
* We are using USAT because it allows us to:
  * Measure satisfaction directly vs. indirectly.
  * Connect satisfaction ratings and open ended responses back to changes in our product.
  * Compare and contrast USAT survey data against our other company wide metrics (System Usability Scale (SUS)).

### Satisfaction surveys across GitLab

There are two teams across GitLab who run separate, but related satisfaction surveys. UX Research conducts the User Satisfaction (USAT) survey and Customer Success conducts the All-Customer Satisfaction survey. This [handbook section](/handbook/sales/field-operations/customer-success-operations/cs-ops-programs/nps-csat-scores/#what-are-the-differences-between-the-all-customer-csat-and-usat-surveys) has more details on how these two satisfaction surveys are different.

### How the USAT survey is run

UX Research determines our USAT score for paid users of GitLab.com and self-managed GitLab on a quarterly basis through a survey launched through Qualtrics. A [USAT template issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/USAT%20Survey%20(UX%20Research%20only).md?ref_type=heads) is created by the UX Research DRI at the beginning of each quarter. The issue template contains background information, research goals, and processes on conducting the survey from start to finish. Data is collected over a period of four weeks starting in the beginning of each quarter and the survey stays open until we have met our [data collection goals](/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/usat/#sampling-goals). The next two weeks after data collection are used to clean, analyze, and report on the survey responses. All documents created are stored in an [internal only Google Drive within UX Research](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ia-SJujFRWgOpnBGUdLE6gAWE8ldf0DM).

#### USAT questions

1. How satisfied are you with GitLab (the product)?  
   * Very dissatisfied  
   * Dissatisfied  
   * Neutral  
   * Satisfied  
   * Very satisfied  
2. Why are you satisfied or dissatisfied with GitLab (the product)? (optional)  
   * Note: Open text field  
3. How could we improve your satisfaction with GitLab (the product)? (optional)  
   * Note: Open text field  
4. Would you be willing to talk with someone at GitLab about your feedback? This would be for research purposes, not for sales or marketing.  
   * Yes, I would be willing to discuss my feedback (please enter the email address where you would like to be contacted)  
   * No, I would not like to be contacted

### Current workflow

#### Sampling goals

UX Research aims for a **sample size of 384 total responses** with plan type proportions for our sample to be +/- 3% compared to the population proportion. Self-managed users are excluded from this proportion because we've traditionally had difficulty recruiting them for research. When we do capture responses from self-managed users (roughly once a year), we aim for 50-100 responses, which is based on the number of self-managed user responses to past System Usability Scale surveys.

#### Data analysis

Data analysis consists of two components: quantitative analysis and open response coding.

1. **Quantitative analysis:** The majority of the quantitative analysis is accomplished by using the [analysis template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Klb9RO83F7EiB6TojIxvr-qEqyXjr36P7LJ-S4b0924/edit?usp=sharing). The final cleaned data inserted in the `completed` tab automatically updates information in the `summary` tab, which shows the overall results. From there, the UX Research DRI can transpose the results from the `summary` tab and insert them into the [USAT Google Slide deck template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HZybf-BPssjsI0ppen5ehdGSJ5vOqr1Socjg2g0jErs/edit?usp=sharing).
2. **Open response coding:** The UX Research DRI will review the open response feedback left by USAT respondents in the `open ended feedback` tab of the [analysis template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Klb9RO83F7EiB6TojIxvr-qEqyXjr36P7LJ-S4b0924/edit?usp=sharing) and categorize the data into a list of pre-defined themes (see `theme glossary` tab for descriptions and examples for each theme).

#### Deployment

##### Generating a list of eligible users

At the beginning of each quarter, the UX Research DRI will generate a list of eligible users to distribute the USAT survey through the following steps:

1. Generate a new list of paid GitLab.com users to contact by using the following [query](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XSABfApXJY_VHm7Q9j4V64xsMNkSorb5SWcLn-b4Tfk/edit?usp=sharing) in Snowflake. Query for approximately 40,000 user IDs and email addresses. Note: You will need access to Snowflake and SAFE data to query the data tables in this step. If you do not have access to one or both, please create an [Access Request issue](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request).
2. Contact the Research Operations Coordinator through a [recruiting request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Recruiting%20request.md?ref_type=heads) template to generate a list of paid self-managed GitLab users.
3. Create a list of users you've compiled in steps 1-2 within the [USAT user Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y9cedI2uoHNaoZ1IgXkH7CB0fecvlg-RGsJp_mihpEI/edit#gid=0) to track contacts for the quarter.
4. Remove users that were contacted more than 12 months ago from [the list of previously contacted users](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9xOh5L9QJGdW9tq89rcADvo5jozRxdo7KiO2z0HLAU/edit#gid=0).
5. Create a copy of the sheet containing the users you will contact this quarter and insert it in the [CSM / UX Survey Participants Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ecM1ptkaNfNA0Im9wHulcl64QrCBOybQ). Contact the Customer Success team, so can avoid contacting the same users in their Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) survey.
6. Calculate the [proportions by plan type](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/views/DraftTDLicensedUsersbyProductRatePlanName/TDLicensedUsersbyProductRatePlanName?:iid=1) for the current quarter. Add these percentages to the user list to help calculate how many users for each plan type you need to invite. The end goal is to achieve a sample breakdown that roughly matches the population's breakdown (+/- 3%). Note: You will need access to Tableau and SAFE data to view the link in this step. If you do not have access to one or both, please create an [Access Request issue](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request).
7. Create a new project in Rally UXR and upload the list of user contacts to the project.

##### Sending an email wave

1. Using the percentages you calculated in the `percentages` tab of the [USAT user list Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y9cedI2uoHNaoZ1IgXkH7CB0fecvlg-RGsJp_mihpEI/edit#gid=776912528), determine how many users for each plan type you need to contact for the wave. If it's the first wave, use the population proportions. If it's a subsequent wave, use the proportions you calculate based on the responses so far (see next point).
2. To calculate your current sample plan proportions, download your survey results from Qualtrics and/or Rally. Calculate the percentage breakdown of plans so far. Then subtract that number from the population percentage and add the result to the population percentage.
An example with fake numbers:

    * Population percentage for Ultimate = 73%
    * Percentage of Ultimate plan types after sending wave 1 = 65%
    * Wave 2 percentage for Ultimate: (73% - 65%) + 73% = 81%
    In this example, the sample is under the population, hence the next wave percentage is higher than the population to try to get within 3% of the population percentage for Ultimate.

3. Waves should be ~5,000 users each. Mark the desired number of users out of that 5,000 that fit your percentages for each plan type with the name of the wave you are sending.
4. In your Rally UXR project, filter out `@gitlab.com` email addresses, users who are on cooldowns/opted out of emails, and users contacted for previous USAT surveys from the past 12 months.
5. After filtering out those individuals, select the number of emails for your most recent wave.
6. Create a new email distribution using the `USAT survey template` email in Rally.
7. Send the email distribution. Typically emails are scheduled to go out Monday - Friday early in the morning US time (8 - 9am Eastern Time) with the goal of maximizing visibility and responses.

Once all email waves have been sent and you've hit the sample size goal for the quarter, add the user IDs and email addresses that were used this quarter to the [previously contacted sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9xOh5L9QJGdW9tq89rcADvo5jozRxdo7KiO2z0HLAU/edit#gid=0), noting the quarter they were contacted. This allows us to avoid contacting the same users too frequently.

### Outreach to USAT responders

When filling in the survey, UX Research gives USAT respondents the option to indicate whether they would be open to a follow up interview. As part of the analysis, the UX Research DRI will compile a list of users who agreed to the follow up interview (see [Google Sheet template for USAT follow up users](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1425a6pwfjTKjTpiNKPGYzvwzEHUgm5L3JorFv8cE2wk/edit?usp=sharing)).

After the research report is shared out, the UX Research DRI will notify Product Managers, Product Designers, and Customer Success Managers about USAT responders who opted into contact via this [USAT Responder Outreach issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/USAT%20Responder%20Outreach%20(UX%20Research%20only).md?ref_type=heads). The USAT responder outreach workflow is described in more detail [here](/handbook/product/product-processes/#usat-responder-outreach).

### Displaying the data

UX Research creates and communicates the [USAT reports](/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/usat/#past-usat-reports) and partners with Product Data Insights to maintain the [USAT dashboards for the UX department](/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/#product-customer-satisfaction-usat-score).

#### USAT dashboards and maintenance

There are two internal dashboards in Tableau meant for presenting USAT results:

* [USAT Scores](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/views/DRAFT-UXKPIs/WIPDRAFTCSATScores?:iid=7): This dashboard shows the number and percentage of responses between those who are satisfied with GitLab the product (ratings of `satisfied` and `very satisfied`) and those who are not (ratings of `neutral`, `dissatisfied`, and `very dissatisfied`).
* [USAT Line Chart](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/views/DRAFT-UXKPIs/WIPDRAFTCSATLineChart?:iid=7): This dashboard shows the USAT score on a quarterly basis in order to track our score over time.

These dashboards can also be found in the [UX Department Performance Indicators page](/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/#regular-performance-indicators).

The survey data in the [analysis template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Klb9RO83F7EiB6TojIxvr-qEqyXjr36P7LJ-S4b0924/edit?usp=sharing) gets connected to Tableau to show data from the current and previous quarters. UX Research is responsible for working with Product Data Insights to update these Tableau dashboards each quarter.

#### Follow up questions

For past reports, UX Research has gotten requests to answer follow up questions about the USAT survey data (for example: What is the breakdown of company size across the survey responses?). When these requests arise, we've partnered with Product Data Insights to get support connecting USAT respondents to internal data sources (i.e., Snowflake). We create an `ad hoc request` issue in the [Product Data Insights project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics) in GitLab and submit this request to a [member of their team](/handbook/product/groups/product-analysis/#team-members).
